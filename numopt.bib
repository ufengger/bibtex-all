  abstract =     {Bayesian optimization has emerged at the forefront of
                  expensive black-box optimization due to its data efficiency.
                  Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of studies on the
                  development of new Bayesian optimization algorithms and their
                  applications. Hence, this paper attempts to provide a
                  comprehensive and updated survey of recent advances in
                  Bayesian optimization and identify interesting open problems.
                  We categorize the existing work on Bayesian optimization into
                  nine main groups according to the motivations and focus of the
                  proposed algorithms. For each category, we present the main
                  advances with respect to the construction of surrogate models
                  and adaptation of the acquisition functions. Finally, we
                  discuss the open questions and suggest promising future
                  research directions, in particular with regard to
                  heterogeneity, privacy preservation, and fairness in
                  distributed and federated optimization systems.},
