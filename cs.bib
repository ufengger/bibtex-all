                  networks based on geometric (Clifford) algebra and convex
                  optimization. We show that optimal weights of deep ReLU neural
                  networks are given by the wedge product of training samples
                  when trained with standard regularized loss. Furthermore, the
                  training problem reduces to convex optimization over wedge
                  product features, which encode the geometric structure of the
                  training dataset. This structure is given in terms of signed
                  volumes of triangles and parallelotopes generated by data
                  vectors. The convex problem finds a small subset of samples
                  via $\ell_1$ regularization to discover only relevant wedge
                  product features. Our analysis provides a novel perspective on
                  the inner workings of deep neural networks and sheds light on
                  the role of the hidden layers.},

  abstract =     {Message passing mechanism contributes to the success of GNNs
                  in various applications, but also brings the oversquashing
                  problem. Recent works combat oversquashing by improving the
                  graph spectrums with rewiring techniques, disrupting the
                  structural bias in graphs, and having limited improvement on
                  oversquashing in terms of oversquashing measure. Motivated by
                  unitary RNN, we propose Graph Unitary Message Passing (GUMP)
                  to alleviate oversquashing in GNNs by applying unitary
                  adjacency matrix for message passing. To design GUMP, a
                  transformation is first proposed to make general graphs have
                  unitary adjacency matrix and keep its structural bias. Then,
                  unitary adjacency matrix is obtained with a unitary projection
                  algorithm, which is implemented by utilizing the intrinsic
                  structure of unitary adjacency matrix and allows GUMP to be
                  permutation-equivariant. Experimental results show the
                  effectiveness of GUMP in improving the performance on various
                  graph learning tasks.},

                  generation and have gained widespread usage; however, the
                  underlying factors contributing to the performance disparity
                  between stochastic and deterministic (i.e., the probability
                  flow ODEs) sampling schemes remain unclear. We introduce a
                  novel formulation of diffusion models using Feynman's path
                  integral, which is a formulation originally developed for
                  quantum physics. We find this formulation providing
                  comprehensive descriptions of score-based generative models,
                  and demonstrate the derivation of backward stochastic
                  differential equations and loss functions.The formulation
                  accommodates an interpolating parameter connecting stochastic
                  and deterministic sampling schemes, and we identify this
                  parameter as a counterpart of Planck's constant in quantum
                  physics. This analogy enables us to apply the
                  Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) expansion, a well-established
                  technique in quantum physics, for evaluating the negative
                  log-likelihood to assess the performance disparity between
                  stochastic and deterministic sampling schemes.},

                  This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment,
                  and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state
                  network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under
                  this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move
                  forward by avoiding other agents was investigated.
                  Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice
                  between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the
                  bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations
                  results indicated that the learning was successful when the
