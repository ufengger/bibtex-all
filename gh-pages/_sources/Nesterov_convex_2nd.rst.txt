Introduction
------------

In our opinion, the main fact, which should be known to any person dealing with
optimization models, is that in general, optimization problems are unsolvable.
This statement, which is usually missing in standard optimization courses, is
very important for understanding optimization theory and the logic of its
development in the past and in the future.
