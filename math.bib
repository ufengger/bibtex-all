  abstract =     {This paper presents a selected tour through the theory and
                  applications of lifts of convex sets. A lift of a convex set
                  is a higher-dimensional convex set that projects onto the
                  original set. Many convex sets have lifts that are
                  dramatically simpler to describe than the original set.
                  Finding such simple lifts has significant algorithmic
                  implications, particularly for optimization problems. We
                  consider both the classical case of polyhedral lifts,
                  described by linear inequalities, as well as spectrahedral
                  lifts, defined by linear matrix inequalities, with a focus on
                  recent developments related to spectrahedral lifts. Given a
                  convex set, ideally we would either like to find a
                  (low-complexity) polyhedral or spectrahedral lift, or find an
                  obstruction proving that no such lift is possible. To this
                  end, we explain the connection between the existence of lifts
                  of a convex set and certain structured factorizations of its
                  associated slack operator. Based on this characterization, we
                  describe a uniform approach, via sums of squares, to the
                  construction of spectrahedral lifts of convex sets and
                  illustrate the method on several families of examples.
                  Finally, we discuss two flavors of obstruction to the
                  existence of lifts: one related to facial structure, and the
                  other related to algebraic properties of the set in question.
                  Rather than being exhaustive, our aim is to illustrate the
                  richness of the area. We touch on a range of different topics
                  related to the existence of lifts, and present many examples
                  of lifts from different areas of mathematics and its
                  applications.},

                  nonlinear and possibly chaotic dynamics, and sparse
                  observations in space and time. We propose a novel filtering
                  methodology that harnesses transportation of measures, convex
                  optimization, and ideas from probabilistic graphical models to
                  yield robust ensemble approximations of the filtering
                  distribution in high dimensions. Our approach can be
                  understood as the natural generalization of the ensemble
                  Kalman filter (EnKF) to nonlinear updates, using stochastic or
                  deterministic couplings. The use of nonlinear updates can
                  reduce the intrinsic bias of the EnKF at a marginal increase
                  in computational cost. We avoid any form of importance
                  sampling and introduce non-Gaussian localization approaches
                  for dimension scalability. Our framework achieves
                  state-of-the-art tracking performance on challenging

                  have become ubiquitous. They are routinely solved with various
                  specialized first-order methods. Although such methods are
                  often fast, they usually struggle with not-so-well conditioned
                  problems. In this paper, specialized variants of an interior

                  for problems of this class. Computational experience on a

                  optimization, classification of data coming from functional
                  Magnetic Resonance Imaging, restoration of images corrupted by
                  Poisson noise, and classification via regularized logistic
                  regression, provides substantial evidence that interior point
                  methods, equipped with suitable linear algebra, can offer a
                  noticeable advantage over first-order approaches.},

                  problems in probability and information theory. In this work
                  we combine the categorical formalism with the traditional
                  quantitative notions of entropy, mutual information, and data
                  processing inequalities. We show that several quantitative
                  aspects of information theory can be captured by an enriched
                  version of Markov categories, where the spaces of morphisms
                  are equipped with a divergence or even a metric. As it is
                  customary in information theory, mutual information can be
                  defined as a measure of how far a joint source is from
                  displaying independence of its components. More strikingly,
                  Markov categories give a notion of determinism for sources and
                  channels, and we can define entropy exactly by measuring how
                  far a source or channel is from being deterministic. This
                  recovers Shannon and R\'enyi entropies, as well as the
                  Gini-Simpson index used in ecology to quantify diversity, and

  abstract =     {Randomized numerical linear algebra - RandNLA, for short -
                  concerns the use of randomization as a resource to develop
                  improved algorithms for large-scale linear algebra
                  computations. The origins of contemporary RandNLA lay in
                  theoretical computer science, where it blossomed from a simple
                  idea: randomization provides an avenue for computing
                  approximate solutions to linear algebra problems more
                  efficiently than deterministic algorithms. This idea proved
                  fruitful in the development of scalable algorithms for machine
                  learning and statistical data analysis applications. However,
                  RandNLA's true potential only came into focus upon integration
                  with the fields of numerical analysis and "classical"
                  numerical linear algebra. Through the efforts of many
                  individuals, randomized algorithms have been developed that
                  provide full control over the accuracy of their solutions and
                  that can be every bit as reliable as algorithms that might be
                  found in libraries such as LAPACK. Recent years have even seen
                  the incorporation of certain RandNLA methods into MATLAB, the
                  NAG Library, NVIDIA's cuSOLVER, and SciKit-Learn. For all its
                  success, we believe that RandNLA has yet to realize its full
                  potential. In particular, we believe the scientific community
                  stands to benefit significantly from suitably defined
                  "RandBLAS" and "RandLAPACK" libraries, to serve as standards
                  conceptually analogous to BLAS and LAPACK. This 200-page
                  monograph represents a step toward defining such standards. In
                  it, we cover topics spanning basic sketching, least squares
                  and optimization, low-rank approximation, full matrix
                  decompositions, leverage score sampling, and sketching data
                  with tensor product structures (among others). Much of the
                  provided pseudo-code has been tested via publicly available
                  MATLAB and Python implementations.},

                  convex optimization that is effective in theory and practice.
                  A key notion in their theory is that of a self-concordant
                  barrier. We give a suitable generalization of self-concordance
                  to Riemannian manifolds and show that it gives the same
                  structural results and guarantees as in the Euclidean setting,
                  in particular local quadratic convergence of Newton's method.
                  We analyze a path-following method for optimizing compatible
                  objectives over a convex domain for which one has a
                  self-concordant barrier, and obtain the standard complexity
                  guarantees as in the Euclidean setting. We provide general
                  constructions of barriers, and show that on the space of
                  positive-definite matrices and other symmetric spaces, the
                  squared distance to a point is self-concordant. To demonstrate
                  the versatility of our framework, we give algorithms with
                  state-of-the-art complexity guarantees for the general class
                  of scaling and non-commutative optimization problems, which
                  have been of much recent interest, and we provide the first
                  algorithms for efficiently finding high-precision solutions

  abstract =     {Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding
                  the convergence and generalization properties of
                  gradient-based methods for training overparameterized learning
                  models. However, many aspects including the role of small
                  random initialization and how the various parameters of the
                  model are coupled during gradient-based updates to facilitate
                  good generalization remain largely mysterious. A series of
                  recent papers have begun to study this role for non-convex
                  formulations of symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrix
                  sensing problems which involve reconstructing a low-rank PSD
                  matrix from a few linear measurements. The underlying
                  symmetry/PSDness is crucial to existing convergence and
                  generalization guarantees for this problem. In this paper, we
                  study a general overparameterized low-rank matrix sensing
                  problem where one wishes to reconstruct an asymmetric
                  rectangular low-rank matrix from a few linear measurements. We
                  prove that an overparameterized model trained via factorized
                  gradient descent converges to the low-rank matrix generating
                  the measurements. We show that in this setting, factorized
                  gradient descent enjoys two implicit properties: (1) coupling
                  of the trajectory of gradient descent where the factors are
                  coupled in various ways throughout the gradient update
                  trajectory and (2) an algorithmic regularization property
                  where the iterates show a propensity towards low-rank models
                  despite the overparameterized nature of the factorized model.
                  These two implicit properties in turn allow us to show that
                  the gradient descent trajectory from small random
                  initialization moves towards solutions that are both globally
                  optimal and generalize well.},
