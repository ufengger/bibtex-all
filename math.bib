  abstract =     {This paper presents a selected tour through the theory and
                  applications of lifts of convex sets. A lift of a convex set
                  is a higher-dimensional convex set that projects onto the
                  original set. Many convex sets have lifts that are
                  dramatically simpler to describe than the original set.
                  Finding such simple lifts has significant algorithmic
                  implications, particularly for optimization problems. We
                  consider both the classical case of polyhedral lifts,
                  described by linear inequalities, as well as spectrahedral
                  lifts, defined by linear matrix inequalities, with a focus on
                  recent developments related to spectrahedral lifts. Given a
                  convex set, ideally we would either like to find a
                  (low-complexity) polyhedral or spectrahedral lift, or find an
                  obstruction proving that no such lift is possible. To this
                  end, we explain the connection between the existence of lifts
                  of a convex set and certain structured factorizations of its
                  associated slack operator. Based on this characterization, we
                  describe a uniform approach, via sums of squares, to the
                  construction of spectrahedral lifts of convex sets and
                  illustrate the method on several families of examples.
                  Finally, we discuss two flavors of obstruction to the
                  existence of lifts: one related to facial structure, and the
                  other related to algebraic properties of the set in question.
                  Rather than being exhaustive, our aim is to illustrate the
                  richness of the area. We touch on a range of different topics
                  related to the existence of lifts, and present many examples
                  of lifts from different areas of mathematics and its
                  applications.},
