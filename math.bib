  abstract =     {This paper presents a selected tour through the theory and
                  applications of lifts of convex sets. A lift of a convex set
                  is a higher-dimensional convex set that projects onto the
                  original set. Many convex sets have lifts that are
                  dramatically simpler to describe than the original set.
                  Finding such simple lifts has significant algorithmic
                  implications, particularly for optimization problems. We
                  consider both the classical case of polyhedral lifts,
                  described by linear inequalities, as well as spectrahedral
                  lifts, defined by linear matrix inequalities, with a focus on
                  recent developments related to spectrahedral lifts. Given a
                  convex set, ideally we would either like to find a
                  (low-complexity) polyhedral or spectrahedral lift, or find an
                  obstruction proving that no such lift is possible. To this
                  end, we explain the connection between the existence of lifts
                  of a convex set and certain structured factorizations of its
                  associated slack operator. Based on this characterization, we
                  describe a uniform approach, via sums of squares, to the
                  construction of spectrahedral lifts of convex sets and
                  illustrate the method on several families of examples.
                  Finally, we discuss two flavors of obstruction to the
                  existence of lifts: one related to facial structure, and the
                  other related to algebraic properties of the set in question.
                  Rather than being exhaustive, our aim is to illustrate the
                  richness of the area. We touch on a range of different topics
                  related to the existence of lifts, and present many examples
                  of lifts from different areas of mathematics and its
                  applications.},

                  state-space models with intractable transition kernels,
                  nonlinear and possibly chaotic dynamics, and sparse
                  observations in space and time. We propose a novel filtering
                  methodology that harnesses transportation of measures, convex
                  optimization, and ideas from probabilistic graphical models to
                  yield robust ensemble approximations of the filtering
                  distribution in high dimensions. Our approach can be
                  understood as the natural generalization of the ensemble
                  Kalman filter (EnKF) to nonlinear updates, using stochastic or
                  deterministic couplings. The use of nonlinear updates can
                  reduce the intrinsic bias of the EnKF at a marginal increase
                  in computational cost. We avoid any form of importance
                  sampling and introduce non-Gaussian localization approaches
                  for dimension scalability. Our framework achieves
                  state-of-the-art tracking performance on challenging
                  configurations of the Lorenz-96 model in the chaotic regime.},

  abstract =     {Large-scale optimization problems that seek sparse solutions
                  have become ubiquitous. They are routinely solved with various
                  specialized first-order methods. Although such methods are
                  often fast, they usually struggle with not-so-well conditioned
                  problems. In this paper, specialized variants of an interior
                  point-proximal method of multipliers are proposed and analyzed
                  for problems of this class. Computational experience on a
                  variety of problems, namely, multi-period portfolio
                  optimization, classification of data coming from functional
                  Magnetic Resonance Imaging, restoration of images corrupted by
                  Poisson noise, and classification via regularized logistic
                  regression, provides substantial evidence that interior point
                  methods, equipped with suitable linear algebra, can offer a
                  noticeable advantage over first-order approaches.},

                  sequences are complex sequences with unit amplitude and
                  particular phase shifts, as opposed to Walsh and PN codes
                  which are real and binary valued, most commonly $\pm 1$ when
                  used in communication systems. ZC sequences have a number of
                  remarkable and desirable properties. Because of these uniquely
