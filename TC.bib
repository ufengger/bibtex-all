  abstract =     {Over the past three years it has become evident that fake news
                  is a danger to democracy. However, until now there has been no
                  clear understanding of how to define fake news, much less how
                  to model it. This paper addresses both these issues. A
                  definition of fake news is given, and two approaches for the
                  modelling of fake news and its impact in elections and
                  referendums are introduced. The first approach, based on the
                  idea of a representative voter, is shown to be suitable to
                  obtain a qualitative understanding of phenomena associated
                  with fake news at a macroscopic level. The second approach,
                  based on the idea of an election microstructure, describes the
                  collective behaviour of the electorate by modelling the voting
                  preferences of individual members of the electorate. It is
                  shown through a simulation study that the mere knowledge that
                  pieces of fake news may be in circulation goes a long way
                  towards mitigating the impact of fake news.},
