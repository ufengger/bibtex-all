Counterinsurgency from the Air
------------------------------

When Ernesto “Che” Guevara wrote these lines, in 1960, they were still true:One of the favorite arms of the enemy army, supposed to be decisive in modern times, is aviation. Nevertheless, this has no use whatsoever during the period that guerrilla warfare is in its first stages, with small concentrations of men in rugged places. The utility of aviation lies in the systematic destruction of visible and organized defenses; and for this there must be large concentrations of men who construct these defenses, something that does not exist in this type of warfare.

Guerrilla warfare has always posed problems for major powers, which regularly become bogged down in asymmetrical conflicts. Instead of direct confrontation, insurgents, in order to compensate for their provisional weakness, favor skirmishes and ambushes. By striking, then immediately withdrawing, they remain elusive. The drone seems to provide a tardy resolution to this historical problem: in a radically absolute form, it turns against the guerrillas their own long-established principle, namely, deprive the enemy of an enemy. An insurgent confronted by an army of drones no longer has any target to attack. “We pray to Allah that we have American soldiers to kill. These bombs from the sky we cannot fight,” said Maulvi Abdullah Haijazi, an Afghan villager reacting to American strikes.4 American officers delight in those words; they consider the statement as confirming the implacable efficacy of their new weapon.

This debate over the respective merits of ground and air warfare is of a quasi-metaphysical nature: can counterinsurgency rise to the level of an aero-policy without losing its soul? There is of course a risk that in the course of the operation, the strategy—together with politics—may be lost in the clouds.

The partisans of counterinsurgency with drones claim to have succeeded in avoiding the mistakes of the past, and all thanks to the progress of technology. To be sure, in the past “the negative effects of imprecise weapons and collateral damage appear to have more than counteracted the tactical advantages” of aviation. In fact, they go on to say, it was those unfortunate historical experiences that lent credibility to “the truism that COIN is about boots on the ground and that airpower is counterproductive.”13 But all that is now behind us: the drone is a highly technological instrument. The twofold revolution in persistent surveillance and in the precision of targeting, they declare, has consigned those old objections to the dustbins of history.

As Hannah Arendt warned us, the problem of political lying is that the liar himself ends up believing his lies.14 Certainly the overall impression here seems to be that of a discursive self-intoxication. As a result of repeatedly proclaiming that drones and other surgical strikes are so accurate that they cause no more than negligible collateral damage, supporters of that strategy seem truly to have come to believe that all serious adverse effects have been eliminated. However, the facts won’t go away, and their message is quite the opposite.

In the first place, they pointed out, the end effect of such strikes was to drive the civilian population into the arms of the extremist groups that on the whole appeared “less ominous than a faceless enemy that wages war from afar and often kills more civilians than militants.”

Third, and perhaps above all: “The use of drones displays every characteristic of a tactic—or, more accurately, a piece of technology—substituting for a strategy.”18 Their final diagnosis was that by resorting on a massive scale to a technological gadget that took the place of a genuine strategy, the state ran the risk of a rapid stupefying political effect.

What is in fact at stake here, deep down in these internal debates within the U.S. military apparatus, is nothing less than an understanding of politics.

The fact remains that it is this fundamentally politico-military understanding of counterinsurgency, paradoxically inherited from a revolutionary Marxist understanding of armed violence, that today causes the advocates of the demographic- and territory-centered orthodox doctrine to reject the promotion of the drone to the position of being the almost exclusive weapon of American-style counterinsurgency. When Kilcullen opposes the technological fetishism of the drone, it is in the name of that strategic conception, following directly in the footsteps of Galula. “At the operational level counterinsurgency remains a competition between several sides, each seeking to mobilize the population in its cause,” he writes. “The people remain the prize.”

As the counterinsurgency specialists see it, what is happening is a dangerous paradigm switch that undermines both the strategy of the American armed forces and their own institutional position within those forces. To those specialists, the dronization of operations signals the preeminence of the antiterrorism paradigm over that of counterinsurgency.

Originally, they explain, the two expressions were virtually synonymous, differing only in the way they were used. The “antiterrorism” label was, on account of its negative connotations, used mostly as a rhetorical means of delegitimizing adverse insurrectional movements.25 It was in the 1970s in Europe, faced with the actions of the Red Army Faction and the Red Brigades, that antiterrorism progressively turned itself into an independent paradigm, founded upon different principles that broke away from the classic doctrinal framework of counterinsurgency. The differences are significant.

Whereas counterinsurgency is essentially politico-military, antiterrorism fundamentally has to do with policing and security. This fundamental divergence in orientation is reflected in several other distinctive features.

First, there is a difference in the way that the enemy is conceived. Whereas the first paradigm regards insurgents as the “representatives of deeper claims at the heart of society”26 (and it is important to understand the reasons for this, in order to counteract them effectively), the second one, by labeling them “terrorist,” regards them above all as “aberrant individuals,” dangerous figures, quite simply mad, or as incarnations of pure evil.

With these new labels, the targets are no longer political adversaries to be opposed, but criminals to be apprehended or eliminated. Whereas counterinsurgency strategy aims above all to “defeat the insurgents’ strategy, rather than to ‘apprehend the perpetrators’ of specific acts,”27 antiterrorism adopts a strictly opposite way of proceeding: its policing logic individualizes the problem and reduces its objectives to neutralizing, on a case-by-case basis, as many suspects as possible. Whereas counterinsurgency is population-centered, antiterrorist action is individual-centered. It is a matter not of cutting the enemy off from the population but solely of rendering it impossible for him personally to do any more harm. In these circumstances, the solution lies in tracking such people down one by one, regardless of the social or geopolitical reasons for the antagonism they express. Within the categories of policing, political analysis dissolves.

Antiterrorism, which is both moralizing and Manichean, abandons any real analysis of the roots of hostility and its own effects upon it. The binary nature of good and evil is no longer just a rhetorical ploy but is imposed as an analytical category, to the detriment of any consideration of the complexity of strategic relations. Whereas counterinsurgency strategy implies (apart from brute force) compromise, diplomatic action, pressure, and agreements, all of which operate under constraint, antiterrorism excludes any political impact upon the conflict. “We do not negotiate with terrorists” is the key phrase in radically nonstrategic thought.

Dronized manhunting represents the triumph, both practical and doctrinal, of antiterrorism over counterinsurgency. According to this logic, the total body count and a list of hunting trophies take the place of a strategic evaluation of the political effects of armed violence. Successes become statistics. Their evaluation is totally disconnected from their real effects on the ground.

Evidence provided by a Pakistani Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, illustrates the apparent truth of that thesis: “I spent three months trying to recruit and only got 10–15 persons. One US attack and I got 150 volunteers.”29 This pattern seems to have been forgotten by the American forces, which is particularly surprising since it appears printed in black and white in the military’s own handbooks: “Confrontational military action, in exclusion, is counter-productive in most cases; it risks generating popular resentment, creating martyrs that motivate new recruits, and producing cycles of revenge.”30 But is it really a case of forgetfulness?

The partisans of the drone as a privileged weapon of “antiterrorism” promise a war without losses or defeats. What they fail to mention is that it will also be a war without victory. The scenario that looms before us is one of infinite violence, with no possible exit; the paradox of an untouchable power waging interminable wars toward perpetual war.


Drones and Kamikazes
--------------------

Talal Asad suggests that the horror provoked in Western societies by suicide bombings lies in the fact that the author of the attack, through his action, a priori rules out any kind of retributive justice. By dying with his victim, coagulating both crime and punishment within a single action, he makes punishment impossible and thereby deactivates the fundamental resort of a form of justice conceived in the penal mode.11 He will never be able “to pay for what he has done.”
