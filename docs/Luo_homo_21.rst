Introduction
------------

For instance, the ultra dense networks (UDNs) have been introduced to meet the
requirements of explosive data traffic and new quality of service in the 5G
communications. The UAVs are considered to be an important component of the UDNs
to support the accessing density and variety. In the UDNs, the base stations
(BSs) are closely distributed as 50~1000 BSs/km2, or with distances about
30~150 m. A drone with velocity 20 m/s can transfer from one BS to another in
only 1.5 ~ 7.5 seconds. That is, although the UAV predicts the spectrum states,
the prediction result can not be used because the UAV will fly to another
location with a different spectrum environment in the next moment.
