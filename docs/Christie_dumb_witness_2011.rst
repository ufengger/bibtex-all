Another Victim
--------------

There is one piece of advice I offer all my readers. Never take a soldier to a
military play, a sailor to a naval play, a Scotsman to a Scottish play, a
detective to a thrillerâ€”and an actor to any play whatsoever! The shower of
destructive criticism in each case is somewhat devastating.
