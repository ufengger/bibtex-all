  abstract =     {An indoor localization approach uses Wi-Fi Access Points (APs)
                  to estimate the Direction of Arrival (DoA) of the WiFi
                  signals. This paper demonstrates FIND, a tool for Fine INDoor
                  localization based on a software-defined radio, which receives
                  Wi-Fi frames in the 80 MHz band with four antennas. To the
                  best of our knowledge, it is the first-ever prototype that
                  extracts from such frames data in both frequency and time
                  domains to calculate the DoA of Wi-Fi signals in real-time.
                  Apart from other prototypes, we retrieve from frames
                  comprehensive information that could be used to DoA
                  estimation: all preamble fields in the time domain, Channels
                  State Information, and signal-to-noise ratio. Using our
                  device, we collect a dataset for comparing different

                  of wearable sensors or cameras in order to recognise human

                  layer information from WiFi devices for the purpose of passive
                  activity recognition in indoor environments. While such data
                  is ubiquitous, few approaches are designed to utilise large

  abstract =     {Modeling human mobility has a wide range of applications from
                  urban planning to simulations of disease spread. It is well
                  known that humans spend 80 \% of their time indoors but
                  modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to three
                  main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable,
                  low-cost indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space
                  in modeling the frequent indoor mobility, and (iii)
                  multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in mobility. To deal
                  with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a
                  Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor
                  human mobility at multiple spatial scales using WiFi system
                  logs. WiFiMod takes as input enterprise WiFi system logs to
                  extract human mobility trajectories from smartphone digital
                  traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the
                  mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and
                  micro, to design a multi-modal embedding Transformer that
                  predicts user mobility for several hours to an entire day
                  across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding
                  captures the mobility periodicity and correlations across
                  various scales while Transformers capture long-term mobility
                  dependencies boosting model prediction performance. This
                  approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first
                  predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale
                  mobility, micro-mobility, conditioned on the estimated macro
                  mobility distribution, thereby using the topological
                  constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that
                  WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10 \%
                  points higher than the current state-of-art models.
                  Additionally, we present 3 real-world applications of WiFiMod
                  - (i) predict high-density hot pockets for policy-making
                  decisions for COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic
                  simulation of indoor mobility, (iii) design personal
                  assistants.},

  abstract =     {Due to the emergence of various wireless sensing technologies,
                  numerous positioning algorithms have been introduced in the
                  literature, categorized into \emph{geometry-driven
                  positioning} (GP) and \emph{data-driven positioning} (DP).
                  These approaches have complementary limitations, e.g., a
                  non-line-of-sight issue for GP and the lack of a real-time
                  training dataset for DP, calling for combining the two for
                  practical use. To this end, this paper aims at introducing a
                  new principle, called \emph{combinatorial data augmentation}
                  (CDA), a catalyst for the two approaches' tight integration.
                  Specifically, GP-based datasets augmented from different
                  combinations of positioning entities can be used as DP's
                  inputs and labels. We confirm the CDA's effectiveness from
                  field experiments based on WiFi \emph{round-trip times} (RTTs)
                  and \emph{inertial measurement units} (IMUs) by designing
                  several CDA-driven positioning algorithms. First, we show that
                  CDA enables us to quantify the given position estimates'
                  uncertainties. Then, we can filter out unreliable ones for
                  WiFi RTT positioning and compute the covariance matrix of a
                  Kalman filter to integrate two position estimates derived by
                  WiFi RTT and IMUs. The mean and standard deviations of the
                  resultant positioning error are $1.65$ (m) and $1.01$ (m),
                  respectively. Next, we use the above position estimate to its
                  real-time label for \emph{fingerprint-based positioning}
                  (FBP), shown to provide an acceptable positioning accuracy,
                  say the average positioning error of $1.51$ (m) with a
                  standard deviation of $0.88$ (m). Lastly, we discuss the
                  proposed CDA's potential from positioning and beyond
                  positioning perspectives.},

                  The algorithm uses 1) an inertial navigation algorithm to

                  a WiFi-based localization API in industry to obtain positional

                  human-computer interaction and can support different
                  applications such as smart home, VR, and gaming. Traditional
                  approaches usually rely on dedicated sensors that are worn by
                  the user or cameras that require line of sight. In this paper,
                  we present fine-grained finger gesture recognition by using
                  commodity WiFi without requiring user to wear any sensors. Our
                  system takes advantages of the fine-grained Channel State
                  Information available from commodity WiFi devices and the
                  prevalence of WiFi network infrastructures. It senses and
                  identifies subtle movements of finger gestures by examining
                  the unique patterns exhibited in the detailed CSI. We devise
                  environmental noise removal mechanism to mitigate the effect
                  of signal dynamic due to the environment changes. Moreover, we
                  propose to capture the intrinsic gesture behavior to deal with

                  Our experimental evaluation in different environments

                  multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at

                  problems such as effortful map-building processes, changing
                  environments and hardware differences. We tackle these
                  problems focussing on topological maps. These represent
                  discrete locations, such as rooms, and their relations, e.g.,
                  distances and transition frequencies. In our unsupervised
                  method, we employ WiFi signal strength distributions,
                  dimension reduction and clustering. It can be used in settings
                  where users carry mobile devices and follow their normal
                  routine. We aim for applications in short-lived indoor events
                  such as conferences.},

  abstract =     {The popularity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) has provided us
                  with unprecedented opportunities to enable a variety of
                  emerging services in a smart home environment. Among those
                  services, sensing the liquid level in a container is critical
                  to building many smart home and mobile healthcare applications
                  that improve the quality of life. This paper presents
                  LiquidSense, a liquid-level sensing system that is low-cost,
                  high accuracy, widely applicable to different daily liquids
                  and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing
                  smart home networks. LiquidSense uses an existing home WiFi
                  network and a low-cost transducer that attached to the
                  container to sense the resonance of the container for liquid
                  level detection. In particular, our system mounts a low-cost
                  transducer on the surface of the container and emits a
                  well-designed chirp signal to make the container resonant,
                  which introduces subtle changes to the home WiFi signals. By
                  analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi signals,
                  LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for
                  liquid level detection. Our system constructs prediction
                  models for both continuous and discrete predictions using
                  curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate LiquidSense in
                  home environments with containers of three different materials
                  and six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense
                  achieves an overall accuracy of 97 \% for continuous
                  prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for discrete
                  prediction. Results also show that our system has a large
                  coverage in a home environment and works well under
                  non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.},

                  for passive indoor positioning using radio frequency (RF)
                  channel state information (CSI). WiCluster can predict both a
                  zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D position, without
                  using any precise position labels during training. Prior
                  CSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric
                  approaches using digital signal-processing (DSP) and, more
                  recently, parametric approaches (e.g., fully supervised ML
                  methods). However these do not handle the complexity of
                  real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for
                  large-scale commercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based
                  method deteriorates significantly in non-line-of-sight
                  conditions, while supervised ML methods need large amounts of
                  hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In
                  contrast, WiCluster is precise, requires weaker
                  label-information that can be easily collected, and works well
                  in non-line-of-sight conditions. Our first contribution is a
                  novel dimensionality reduction method for charting. It
                  combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale clustering-loss to
                  map the high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D latent
                  space. Our second contribution is two weakly supervised losses
                  that map this latent space into a Cartesian map, resulting in
                  meter-accuracy position results. These losses only require
                  simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the floorplan,
                  approximate access-point locations and a few CSI packets that
                  are labelled with the corresponding zone in the floorplan.

                  differences, typically related to unique variations introduced
                  in the manufacturing process. One way these variations
                  manifest is through unique transient events when a radio

                  (JCR) system based on next-generation IEEE 802.11ay WiFi
                  networks operating in the 60 GHz band. In contrast to most
                  existing approaches for human sensing at millimeter-waves,
                  which employ special-purpose radars to retrieve the
                  small-scale Doppler effect (micro-Doppler) caused by human
                  motion, RAPID achieves radar-level sensing accuracy by
                  retrofitting IEEE 802.11ay access points. For this, it
                  leverages the IEEE 802.11ay beam training mechanism to
                  accurately localize and track multiple individuals, while the
                  in-packet beam tracking fields are exploited to extract the
                  desired micro-Doppler signatures from the time-varying phase
                  of the channel impulse response (CIR). The proposed approach
                  enables activity recognition and person identification with
                  IEEE 802.11ay wireless networks without requiring
                  modifications to the packet structure specified by the
                  standard. RAPID is implemented on an IEEE 802.11ay-compatible
                  FPGA platform with phased antenna arrays, which estimates the
                  CIR from the reflections of transmitted packets. The proposed
                  system is evaluated on a large dataset of CIR measurements,
                  proving robustness across different environments and subjects,
                  and outperforming state-of-the-art sub-6 GHz WiFi sensing
                  techniques. Using two access points, RAPID reliably tracks
                  multiple subjects, reaching activity recognition and person
                  identification accuracies of 94 \% and 90 \%, respectively.},

  abstract =     {Device-free human tracking is an essential ingredient for
                  ubiquitous wireless sensing. Recent passive WiFi tracking
                  systems face the challenges of inaccurate separation of
                  dynamic human components and time-consuming estimation of
                  multi-dimensional signal parameters. In this work, we present
                  a scheme named WiFi Doppler Frequency Shift (WiDFS), which can
                  achieve single-target real-time passive tracking using channel
                  state information (CSI) collected from
                  commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. We consider the
                  typical system setup including a transmitter with a single
                  antenna and a receiver with three antennas; while our scheme
                  can be readily extended to another setup. To remove the impact
                  of transceiver asynchronization, we first apply CSI
                  cross-correlation between each RX antenna pair. We then
                  combine them to estimate a Doppler frequency shift (DFS) in a
                  short-time window. After that, we leverage the DFS estimate to
                  separate dynamic human components from CSI self-correlation
                  terms of each antenna, thereby separately calculating
                  angle-of-arrival (AoA) and human reflection distance for
                  tracking. In addition, a hardware calibration algorithm is
                  presented to refine the spacing between RX antennas and
                  eliminate the hardware-related phase differences between them.
                  A prototype demonstrates that WiDFS can achieve real-time
                  tracking with a median position error of 72.32 cm in
                  multipath-rich environments.},

                  non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings which is a very challenging
                  problem in robotics. It does so by analyzing the phase of
                  their communicated WiFi signals as the robots traverse the
                  environment. This capability, based on the theory developed in
                  our prior works, is made available for the first time as an
                  opensource tool. It is motivated by the lack of easily
                  deployable solutions that use robots' local resources (e.g
                  WiFi) for sensing in NLOS. This has implications for
                  localization, ad-hoc robot networks, and security in
                  multi-robot teams, amongst others. The toolbox is designed for
                  distributed and online deployment on robot platforms using
                  commodity hardware and on-board sensors. We also release

                  leads to a median error of 0.5m and 0.9m for localization in
                  LOS and NLOS settings respectively, in a hardware deployment

                  inverse scattering. In this work we present a phaseless
                  inverse scattering method that can accurately image and
                  reconstruct objects even with these attributes. The
                  reconstruction accuracy obtained under these conditions has
                  not been achieved previously and can therefore open up the
                  area to technologically important applications such as indoor
                  Radio Frequency (RF) and microwave imaging. The novelty of the
                  approach is that it utilizes a high frequency approximation
                  for waves passing through lossy media to provide corrections
                  to the conventional Rytov approximation (RA). We refer to this
                  technique as the Extended Phaseless Rytov Approximation for
                  Low Loss Media (xPRA-LM). Simulation as well as experimental
                  results are provided for indoor RF imaging using phaseless
                  measurements from 2.4 GHz based WiFi nodes. We demonstrate
                  that the approach provides accurate reconstruction of an
                  object up to relative permittivities of $15+j1.5$ for object
                  sizes greater than $20 \lambda$ ($\lambda$ is wavelength
                  inside object). Even at higher relative permittivities of up
                  to $\epsilon_r=77+j 7$, object shape reconstruction remains
                  accurate, however the reconstruction amplitude is less
                  accurate. These results have not been obtained before and can
                  be utilized to achieve the potential of RF and microwave

                  enabling emerging human-computer interaction applications. The
                  corresponding technique has gradually evolved from the
                  classification of multiple activity types to more fine-grained
                  tracking of 3D human poses. However, existing WiFi-based 3D
                  human pose tracking is limited to a set of predefined
                  activities. In this work, we present Winect, a 3D human pose
                  tracking system for free-form activity using commodity WiFi
                  devices. Our system tracks free-form activity by estimating a
                  3D skeleton pose that consists of a set of joints of the human
                  body. In particular, we combine signal separation and joint
                  movement modeling to achieve free-form activity tracking. Our
                  system first identifies the moving limbs by leveraging the
                  two-dimensional angle of arrival of the signals reflected off
                  the human body and separates the entangled signals for each
                  limb. Then, it tracks each limb and constructs a 3D skeleton
                  of the body by modeling the inherent relationship between the
                  movements of the limb and the corresponding joints. Our
                  evaluation results show that Winect is environment-independent
                  and achieves centimeter-level accuracy for free-form activity
                  tracking under various challenging environments including the

                  neural network models trained for recognition with data

                  Specifically, we apply pseudo labeling and consistency

                  produce pseudo labels and align instance feature of the target

                  critical component to achieve this ubiquitous connectivity for
                  a wide range of services, and are composed of terminal devices
                  (i.e., nodes), such as sensors of various types, and wall
                  powered gateway devices, which provide further internet
                  connectivity (e..g, via WiFi). When considering large indoor
                  areas, such as hospitals or industrial scenarios, the mesh
                  must cover a large area, which introduces concerns regarding
                  range and the number of gateways needed and respective wall
                  cabling infrastructure. Solutions for mesh networks
                  implemented over different wireless protocols exist, like the
                  recent Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1. Besides range concerns,
                  choosing which nodes forward data through the mesh has a large

                  our own design, which acts as a range extender by forwarding
                  packets from end nodes to gateways. We present the relay's
                  design and experimentally determine the packet forwarding
                  efficiency for several scenarios and configurations. In the
                  best case, up to 35 \% of the packets transmitted by 11 nodes
                  can be forwarded to a gateway by a single relay under
                  continuous operation. A battery lifetime of 1 year can be
                  achieved with a relay duty cycle of 20 \%.},

                  information (CSI). Existing WiFi sensing suffers from limited
                  scalability as the system needs to be retrained whenever new

                  when a different environment or user (domain) is involved.
                  This paper proposed a few-shot learning-based WiFi sensing
                  system, named FewSense, which can recognise novel classes in
                  unseen domains with only few samples. Specifically, a feature
                  extractor was pre-trained offline using the source domain
                  data. When the system was applied in the target domain, few
                  samples were used to fine-tune the feature extractor for
                  domain adaptation. Inference was made by computing the cosine

                  In this paper, a system is provided to generate featured
                  trajectories by crowd-sourcing smartphone data. Firstly, we
                  propose a more accurate PDR algorithm for the generation of

                  step counting method and uses the step estimation algorithm o
                  make the trajectory more accurate in length. Next, the
                  barometer is used to segment the tracks of different floors,
                  and the track floors are obtained by WiFi feature clustering.
                  Finally, by finding the turning point as the feature point of
                  the trajectory, the vertices and edges of the trajectory are

  abstract =     {Owing to the plentiful information released by the commodity
                  devices, WiFi signals have been widely studied for various
                  wireless sensing applications. In many works, both received
                  signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the channel state
                  information (CSI) are utilized as the key factors for precise
                  sensing. However, the calculation and relationship between
                  RSSI and CSI is not explained in detail. Furthermore, there
                  are few works focusing on the measurement variation of the
                  WiFi signal which impacts the sensing results. In this paper,
                  the relationship between RSSI and CSI is studied in detail and
                  the measurement variation of amplitude and phase information
                  is investigated by extensive experiments. In the experiments,
                  transmitter and receiver are directly connected by power
                  divider and RF cables and the signal transmission is
                  quantitatively controlled by RF attenuators. By changing the
                  intensity of attenuation, the measurement of RSSI and CSI is
                  carried out under different conditions. From the results, it
                  is found that in order to get a reliable measurement of the
                  signal amplitude and phase by commodity WiFi, the attenuation
                  of the channels should not exceed 60 dB. Meanwhile, the
                  difference between two channels should be lower than 10 dB. An
                  active control mechanism is suggested to ensure the
                  measurement stability. The findings and criteria of this work
                  is promising to facilitate more precise sensing technologies
                  with WiFi signal.},

                  number of recent studies consider WiFi for sensing. In
                  particular, wireless signals are altered (e.g., reflected and
                  attenuated) by the human body and objects in the environment.
                  This can be perceived by an observer to infer information on
                  human activities or changes in the environment and, hence, to
                  "see" over WiFi. Until now, works on WiFi-based sensing have
                  resulted in a set of custom software tools - each designed for
                  a specific purpose. Moreover, given how scattered the
                  literature is, it is difficult to even identify all
                  steps/functions necessary to build a basic system for
                  WiFi-based sensing. This has led to a high entry barrier,
                  hindering further research in this area. There has been no
                  effort to integrate these tools or to build a general software

                  a promising solution in applications such as smart living and
                  remote monitoring due to the pervasive and unobtrusive nature
                  of WiFi signals. However, the efficacy of WiFi signals is
                  prone to be influenced by the change in the ambient
                  environment and varies over different sub-carriers. To remedy
                  this issue, we propose an end-to-end Gabor residual
                  anti-aliasing sensing network (GraSens) to directly recognize
                  the actions using the WiFi signals from the wireless devices
                  in diverse scenarios. In particular, a new Gabor residual
                  block is designed to address the impact of the changing
                  surrounding environment with a focus on learning reliable and
                  robust temporal-frequency representations of WiFi signals. In
                  each block, the Gabor layer is integrated with the
                  anti-aliasing layer in a residual manner to gain the
                  shift-invariant features. Furthermore, fractal temporal and
                  frequency self-attention are proposed in a joint effort to
                  explicitly concentrate on the efficacy of WiFi signals and
                  thus enhance the quality of output features scattered in
                  different subcarriers. Experimental results throughout our
                  wireless-vision action recognition dataset (WVAR) and three

                  sensing have emerged as a new paradigm since it is convenient
                  and not restricted in the environment. In this paper, a new
                  WiFi-based and video-based neural network (WiNN) is proposed
                  to improve the robustness of activity recognition where the
                  synchronized video serves as the supplement for the wireless
                  data. Moreover, a wireless-vision benchmark (WiVi) is

                  gait recognition method, namely GaitFi, which leverages WiFi
                  signals and videos for human identification. In GaitFi,
                  Channel State Information (CSI) that reflects the multi-path
                  propagation of WiFi is collected to capture human gaits, while
                  videos are captured by cameras. To learn robust gait
                  information, we propose a Lightweight Residual Convolution
                  Network (LRCN) as the backbone network, and further propose
                  the two-stream GaitFi by integrating WiFi and vision features
                  for the gait retrieval task. The GaitFi is trained by the
                  triplet loss and classification loss on different levels of
                  features. Extensive experiments are conducted in the real
                  world, which demonstrates that the GaitFi outperforms
                  state-of-the-art gait recognition methods based on single WiFi
                  or camera, achieving 94.2 \% for human identification tasks of
                  12 subjects.},

                  xDom - for robust real-world wireless radio frequency (RF)

                  knowledge, this is the first time such comprehensive attention
                  mechanism is applied to solve RF fingerprinting problem. In
                  this paper, we resort to real-world IoT WiFi and Bluetooth
                  (BT) emissions (instead of synthetic waveform generation) in a
                  rich multipath and unavoidable interference environment in an
                  indoor experimental testbed. We show the impact of the
                  time-frame of capture by including waveforms collected over a
                  span of months and demonstrate the same time-frame and
                  multiple time-frame fingerprinting evaluations. The
                  effectiveness of resorting to a multi-task architecture is
                  also experimentally proven by conducting single-task and

                  state-of-the-art model for fingerprinting. Specifically, we
                  report performance improvements by up to 59.3 \% and 4.91x
                  under single-task WiFi and BT fingerprinting respectively, and
                  up to 50.5 \% increase in fingerprinting accuracy under the

                  systems. While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR
                  sensors in tandem with an odometry sensor, these odometry
                  sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM
                  systems deploy compute and memory intensive search algorithms
                  to detect `Loop Closures', which make the trajectory estimate

                  State Information (CSI) has received great attention in recent
                  years. However, CSI-based sensing systems suffer from
                  performance degradation when deployed in different
                  environments. Existing works solve this problem by domain
                  adaptation using massive unlabeled high-quality data from the
                  new environment, which is usually unavailable in practice. In
                  this paper, we propose a novel augmented environment-invariant
                  robust WiFi gesture recognition system named AirFi that deals
                  with the issue of environment dependency from a new
                  perspective. The AirFi is a novel domain generalization
                  framework that learns the critical part of CSI regardless of
                  different environments and generalizes the model to unseen
                  scenarios, which does not require collecting any data for
                  adaptation to the new environment. AirFi extracts the common
                  features from several training environment settings and
                  minimizes the distribution differences among them. The feature
                  is further augmented to be more robust to environments.
                  Moreover, the system can be further improved by few-shot
                  learning techniques. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
                  AirFi is able to work in different environment settings
                  without acquiring any CSI data from the new environment. The
                  experimental results demonstrate that our system remains
                  robust in the new environment and outperforms the compared

  abstract =     {WiFi-based indoor localization has now matured for over a
                  decade. Most of the current localization algorithms rely on
                  the WiFi access points (APs) in the enterprise network to
                  localize the WiFi user accurately. Thus, the WiFi user's
                  location information could be easily snooped by an attacker
                  listening through a compromised WiFi AP. With indoor
                  localization and navigation being the next step towards
                  automation, it is important to give users the capability to
                  defend against such attacks. In this paper, we present MIRAGE,
                  a system that can utilize the downlink physical layer
                  information to create a defense against an attacker snooping
                  on a WiFi user's location information. MIRAGE achieves this by
                  utilizing the beamforming capability of the transmitter that
                  is already part of the WiFi protocols. With this initial idea,
                  we have demonstrated that the user can obfuscate his/her
                  location from the WiFi AP always with no compromise to the
                  throughput of the existing WiFi communication system and
                  reduce the user location accuracy of the attacker from 2.3m to
                  more than 10m.},

                  and almost-universal approach, in contrast to outdoor
                  environments where GPS is dominant. Recently, machine learning
                  (ML) has emerged as the most promising approach for achieving
                  accurate indoor localization, yet its main challenge is the
                  requirement for large datasets to train the neural networks.
                  The data collection procedure is costly and laborious as the
                  procedure requires extensive measurements and labeling
                  processes for different indoor environments. The situation can
                  be improved by Data Augmentation (DA), which is a general
                  framework to enlarge the datasets for ML, making ML systems
                  more robust and increases their generalization capabilities.
                  In this paper, we propose two simple yet surprisingly
                  effective DA algorithms for channel state information (CSI)
                  based indoor localization motivated by physical
                  considerations. We show that the required number of
                  measurements for a given accuracy requirement may be decreased
                  by an order of magnitude. Specifically, we demonstrate the
                  algorithms' effectiveness by experiments conducted with a
                  measured indoor WiFi measurement dataset: as little as 10 \%
                  of the original dataset size is enough to get the same
                  performance of the original dataset. We also showed that, if
                  we further augment the dataset with proposed techniques we get
                  better test accuracy more than three-fold.},

                  pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion
                  and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest.
                  Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need
                  specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive.
                  Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises
                  significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations,
                  recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D
                  sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection.
                  This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in
                  combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in
                  computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence.
                  We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and

                  AoA) of the WiFi signal reflections to enable WiFi devices to

                  Experimental evaluation under various indoor environments

                  the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such
                  multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims
                  to build models that can process and relate information from
                  multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field
                  of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential.
                  Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this
                  paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine
                  learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go
                  beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and
                  identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal
                  machine learning, namely: representation, translation,
                  alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will
                  enable researchers to better understand the state of the field
                  and identify directions for future research.},

                  packets received from unauthorized WiFi devices outside of

                  on wireless communication standards. In a common industrial
                  scenario, indoor wireless IoT devices communicate with access
                  points to deliver data collected from industrial sensors,
                  robots and factory machines. Due to static or quasi-static
                  locations of IoT devices and access points, historical
                  observations of IoT device channel conditions provide a
                  possibility to precisely identify the device without observing
                  its traditional identifiers (e.g., MAC or IP address). Such
                  device identification methods based on wireless fingerprinting
                  gained increased attention lately as an additional
                  cyber-security mechanism for critical IoT infrastructures. In
                  this paper, we perform a systematic study of a large class of

                  wireless network (e.g., WiFi, 4G/5G) with the augmented

  abstract =     {Fine-grained person perception such as body segmentation and
                  pose estimation has been achieved with many 2D and 3D sensors
                  such as RGB/depth cameras, radars (e.g., RF-Pose) and LiDARs.
                  These sensors capture 2D pixels or 3D point clouds of person
                  bodies with high spatial resolution, such that the existing
                  Convolutional Neural Networks can be directly applied for
                  perception. In this paper, we take one step forward to show
                  that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D
                  sensors: WiFi antennas. To our knowledge, this is the first
                  work to perceive persons with pervasive WiFi devices, which is
                  cheaper and power efficient than radars and LiDARs, invariant
                  to illumination, and has little privacy concern comparing to
                  cameras. We used two sets of off-the-shelf WiFi antennas to
                  acquire signals, i.e., one transmitter set and one receiver
                  set. Each set contains three antennas lined-up as a regular
                  household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a
                  transmitter antenna, penetrates through and reflects on human
                  bodies, furniture and walls, and then superposes at a receiver
                  antenna as a 1D signal sample (instead of 2D pixels or 3D
                  point clouds). We developed a deep learning approach that uses
                  annotations on 2D images, takes the received 1D WiFi signals
                  as inputs, and performs body segmentation and pose estimation
                  in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on over 100000
                  frames under 16 indoor scenes demonstrate that Person-in-WiFi
                  achieved person perception comparable to approaches using 2D
                  images.},

  abstract =     {In Bora et al. (2017), a mathematical framework was developed
                  for compressed sensing guarantees in the setting where the
                  measurement matrix is Gaussian and the signal structure is the
                  range of a generative neural network (GNN). The problem of
                  compressed sensing with GNNs has since been extensively
                  analyzed when the measurement matrix and/or network weights
                  follow a subgaussian distribution. We move beyond the
                  subgaussian assumption, to measurement matrices that are
                  derived by sampling uniformly at random rows of a unitary
                  matrix (including subsampled Fourier measurements as a special
                  case). Specifically, we prove the first known restricted
                  isometry guarantee for generative compressed sensing with
                  subsampled isometries and provide recovery bounds, addressing
                  an open problem of Scarlett et al. (2022, p. 10). Recovery
                  efficacy is characterized by the coherence, a new parameter,
                  which measures the interplay between the range of the network
                  and the measurement matrix. Our approach relies on subspace
                  counting arguments and ideas central to high-dimensional
                  probability. Furthermore, we propose a regularization strategy
                  for training GNNs to have favourable coherence with the
                  measurement operator. We provide compelling numerical
                  simulations that support this regularized training strategy:
                  our strategy yields low coherence networks that require fewer
                  measurements for signal recovery. This, together with our
                  theoretical results, supports coherence as a natural quantity
                  for characterizing generative compressed sensing with
                  subsampled isometries.},

                  sensed information about a human can be used for many good
                  purposes such as enhancing life quality, an adversary can also
                  abuse it to steal private information about the human (e.g.,
                  location, living habits, and behavioral biometric
                  characteristics). However, the literature lacks a systematic
                  understanding of the privacy vulnerabilities of wireless
                  sensing and the defenses against them. In this work, we aim to
                  bridge this gap. First, we propose a framework to systematize
                  wireless sensing-based inference attacks. Our framework
                  consists of three key steps: deploying a sniffing device,
                  sniffing wireless signals, and inferring private information.
                  Our framework can be used to guide the design of new inference
                  attacks since different attacks can instantiate these three
                  steps differently. Second, we propose a defense-in-depth
                  framework to systematize defenses against such inference
                  attacks. The prevention component of our framework aims to
                  prevent inference attacks via obfuscating the wireless signals
                  around a human, while the detection component aims to detect
                  and respond to attacks. Third, based on our attack and defense
                  frameworks, we identify gaps in the existing literature and
                  discuss future research directions.},

  abstract =     {Can we distinguish between two wireless transmitters sending
                  exactly the same message, using the same protocol? The
                  opportunity for doing so arises due to subtle nonlinear
                  variations across transmitters, even those made by the same
                  manufacturer. Since these effects are difficult to model
                  explicitly, we investigate learning device fingerprints using
                  complex-valued deep neural networks (DNNs) that take as input
                  the complex baseband signal at the receiver. We ask whether
                  such fingerprints can be made robust to distribution shifts
                  across time and locations due to clock drift and variations in
                  the wireless channel. In this paper, we point out that, unless
                  proactively discouraged from doing so, DNNs learn these strong
                  confounding features rather than the nonlinear device-specific
                  characteristics that we seek to learn. We propose and evaluate
                  strategies, based on augmentation and estimation, to promote
                  generalization across realizations of these confounding
                  factors, using data from WiFi and ADS-B protocols. We conclude
                  that, while DNN training has the advantage of not requiring
                  explicit signal models, significant modeling insights are
                  required to focus the learning on the effects we wish to
                  capture.},
