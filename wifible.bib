  abstract =     {An indoor localization approach uses WiFi Access Points (APs)
                  to estimate the Direction of Arrival (DoA) of the WiFi
                  signals. This paper demonstrates FIND, a tool for Fine INDoor
                  localization based on a software-defined radio, which receives
                  WiFi frames in the 80 MHz band with four antennas. To the
                  best of our knowledge, it is the first-ever prototype that
                  extracts from such frames data in both frequency and time
                  domains to calculate the DoA of WiFi signals in real-time.
                  Apart from other prototypes, we retrieve from frames
                  comprehensive information that could be used to DoA
                  estimation: all preamble fields in the time domain, Channels
                  State Information, and signal-to-noise ratio. Using our
                  device, we collect a dataset for comparing different
                  algorithms estimating the angle of arrival in the same
                  scenario. Furthermore, we propose a novel calibration method,
                  eliminating the constant phase shift between receiving paths
                  caused by hardware imperfections. All calibration data, as

                  of wearable sensors or cameras in order to recognise human
                  activities. In this work, we extract fine-grained physical
                  layer information from WiFi devices for the purpose of passive
                  activity recognition in indoor environments. While such data
                  is ubiquitous, few approaches are designed to utilise large

                  recognition performance when using multiple views of the
                  transmitted WiFi signal captured by different synchronised
                  receivers. We conduct experiments where the transmitters and

                  cover both Line-of-Sight (LoS) and non LoS (NLoS) conditions.
                  We compare the proposed contrastive learning system with
                  non-contrastive systems and observe a 17.7 \% increase in

  abstract =     {Modeling human mobility has a wide range of applications from
                  urban planning to simulations of disease spread. It is well
                  known that humans spend 80 \% of their time indoors but
                  modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to three
                  main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable,
                  low-cost indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space
                  in modeling the frequent indoor mobility, and (iii)
                  multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in mobility. To deal
                  with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a
                  Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor
                  human mobility at multiple spatial scales using WiFi system
                  logs. WiFiMod takes as input enterprise WiFi system logs to
                  extract human mobility trajectories from smartphone digital
                  traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the
                  mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and
                  micro, to design a multi-modal embedding Transformer that
                  predicts user mobility for several hours to an entire day
                  across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding
                  captures the mobility periodicity and correlations across
                  various scales while Transformers capture long-term mobility
                  dependencies boosting model prediction performance. This
                  approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first
                  predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale
                  mobility, micro-mobility, conditioned on the estimated macro
                  mobility distribution, thereby using the topological
                  constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that
                  WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10 \%
                  points higher than the current state-of-art models.
                  Additionally, we present 3 real-world applications of WiFiMod
                  - (i) predict high-density hot pockets for policy-making
                  decisions for COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic
                  simulation of indoor mobility, (iii) design personal
                  assistants.},

  abstract =     {Due to the emergence of various wireless sensing technologies,
                  numerous positioning algorithms have been introduced in the
                  literature, categorized into \emph{geometry-driven
                  positioning} (GP) and \emph{data-driven positioning} (DP).
                  These approaches have complementary limitations, e.g., a
                  non-line-of-sight issue for GP and the lack of a real-time
                  training dataset for DP, calling for combining the two for
                  practical use. To this end, this paper aims at introducing a
                  new principle, called \emph{combinatorial data augmentation}
                  (CDA), a catalyst for the two approaches' tight integration.
                  Specifically, GP-based datasets augmented from different
                  combinations of positioning entities can be used as DP's
                  inputs and labels. We confirm the CDA's effectiveness from
                  field experiments based on WiFi \emph{round-trip times} (RTTs)
                  and \emph{inertial measurement units} (IMUs) by designing
                  several CDA-driven positioning algorithms. First, we show that
                  CDA enables us to quantify the given position estimates'
                  uncertainties. Then, we can filter out unreliable ones for
                  WiFi RTT positioning and compute the covariance matrix of a
                  Kalman filter to integrate two position estimates derived by
                  WiFi RTT and IMUs. The mean and standard deviations of the
                  resultant positioning error are $1.65$ (m) and $1.01$ (m),
                  respectively. Next, we use the above position estimate to its
                  real-time label for \emph{fingerprint-based positioning}
                  (FBP), shown to provide an acceptable positioning accuracy,
                  say the average positioning error of $1.51$ (m) with a
                  standard deviation of $0.88$ (m). Lastly, we discuss the
                  proposed CDA's potential from positioning and beyond
                  positioning perspectives.},

                  a WiFi-based localization API in industry to obtain positional

                  human-computer interaction and can support different
                  applications such as smart home, VR, and gaming. Traditional
                  approaches usually rely on dedicated sensors that are worn by
                  the user or cameras that require line of sight. In this paper,
                  we present fine-grained finger gesture recognition by using
                  commodity WiFi without requiring user to wear any sensors. Our
                  system takes advantages of the fine-grained Channel State
                  Information available from commodity WiFi devices and the
                  prevalence of WiFi network infrastructures. It senses and
                  identifies subtle movements of finger gestures by examining
                  the unique patterns exhibited in the detailed CSI. We devise
                  environmental noise removal mechanism to mitigate the effect
                  of signal dynamic due to the environment changes. Moreover, we
                  propose to capture the intrinsic gesture behavior to deal with

                  utilize multiple WiFi links and larger bandwidth at 5GHz to

                  Our experimental evaluation in different environments

                  multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at

  abstract =     {The popularity of Internet-of-Things (IoT) has provided us
                  with unprecedented opportunities to enable a variety of
                  emerging services in a smart home environment. Among those
                  services, sensing the liquid level in a container is critical
                  to building many smart home and mobile healthcare applications
                  that improve the quality of life. This paper presents
                  LiquidSense, a liquid-level sensing system that is low-cost,
                  high accuracy, widely applicable to different daily liquids
                  and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing
                  smart home networks. LiquidSense uses an existing home WiFi
                  network and a low-cost transducer that attached to the
                  container to sense the resonance of the container for liquid
                  level detection. In particular, our system mounts a low-cost
                  transducer on the surface of the container and emits a
                  well-designed chirp signal to make the container resonant,
                  which introduces subtle changes to the home WiFi signals. By
                  analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi signals,
                  LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for
                  liquid level detection. Our system constructs prediction
                  models for both continuous and discrete predictions using
                  curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate LiquidSense in
                  home environments with containers of three different materials
                  and six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense
                  achieves an overall accuracy of 97 \% for continuous
                  prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for discrete
                  prediction. Results also show that our system has a large
                  coverage in a home environment and works well under
                  non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.},

                  for passive indoor positioning using radio frequency (RF)
                  channel state information (CSI). WiCluster can predict both a
                  zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D position, without
                  using any precise position labels during training. Prior
                  CSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric
                  approaches using digital signal-processing (DSP) and, more
                  recently, parametric approaches (e.g., fully supervised ML
                  methods). However these do not handle the complexity of
                  real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for
                  large-scale commercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based
                  method deteriorates significantly in non-line-of-sight
                  conditions, while supervised ML methods need large amounts of
                  hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In
                  contrast, WiCluster is precise, requires weaker
                  label-information that can be easily collected, and works well
                  in non-line-of-sight conditions. Our first contribution is a
                  novel dimensionality reduction method for charting. It
                  combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale clustering-loss to
                  map the high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D latent
                  space. Our second contribution is two weakly supervised losses
                  that map this latent space into a Cartesian map, resulting in
                  meter-accuracy position results. These losses only require
                  simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the floorplan,
                  approximate access-point locations and a few CSI packets that
                  are labelled with the corresponding zone in the floorplan.

                  differences, typically related to unique variations introduced
                  in the manufacturing process. One way these variations
                  manifest is through unique transient events when a radio

                  (JCR) system based on next-generation IEEE 802.11ay WiFi
                  networks operating in the 60 GHz band. In contrast to most
                  existing approaches for human sensing at millimeter-waves,
                  which employ special-purpose radars to retrieve the
                  small-scale Doppler effect (micro-Doppler) caused by human
                  motion, RAPID achieves radar-level sensing accuracy by
                  retrofitting IEEE 802.11ay access points. For this, it
                  leverages the IEEE 802.11ay beam training mechanism to
                  accurately localize and track multiple individuals, while the
                  in-packet beam tracking fields are exploited to extract the
                  desired micro-Doppler signatures from the time-varying phase
                  of the channel impulse response (CIR). The proposed approach
                  enables activity recognition and person identification with
                  IEEE 802.11ay wireless networks without requiring
                  modifications to the packet structure specified by the
                  standard. RAPID is implemented on an IEEE 802.11ay-compatible
                  FPGA platform with phased antenna arrays, which estimates the
                  CIR from the reflections of transmitted packets. The proposed
                  system is evaluated on a large dataset of CIR measurements,
                  proving robustness across different environments and subjects,
                  and outperforming state-of-the-art sub-6 GHz WiFi sensing
                  techniques. Using two access points, RAPID reliably tracks
                  multiple subjects, reaching activity recognition and person
                  identification accuracies of 94 \% and 90 \%, respectively.},

  abstract =     {Device-free human tracking is an essential ingredient for
                  ubiquitous wireless sensing. Recent passive WiFi tracking
                  systems face the challenges of inaccurate separation of
                  dynamic human components and time-consuming estimation of
                  multi-dimensional signal parameters. In this work, we present
                  a scheme named WiFi Doppler Frequency Shift (WiDFS), which can
                  achieve single-target real-time passive tracking using channel
                  state information (CSI) collected from
                  commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. We consider the
                  typical system setup including a transmitter with a single
                  antenna and a receiver with three antennas; while our scheme
                  can be readily extended to another setup. To remove the impact
                  of transceiver asynchronization, we first apply CSI
                  cross-correlation between each RX antenna pair. We then
                  combine them to estimate a Doppler frequency shift (DFS) in a
                  short-time window. After that, we leverage the DFS estimate to
                  separate dynamic human components from CSI self-correlation
                  terms of each antenna, thereby separately calculating
                  angle-of-arrival (AoA) and human reflection distance for
                  tracking. In addition, a hardware calibration algorithm is
                  presented to refine the spacing between RX antennas and
                  eliminate the hardware-related phase differences between them.
                  A prototype demonstrates that WiDFS can achieve real-time
                  tracking with a median position error of 72.32 cm in
                  multipath-rich environments.},

                  non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings which is a very challenging
                  problem in robotics. It does so by analyzing the phase of
                  their communicated WiFi signals as the robots traverse the
                  environment. This capability, based on the theory developed in
                  our prior works, is made available for the first time as an
                  opensource tool. It is motivated by the lack of easily
                  deployable solutions that use robots' local resources (e.g
                  WiFi) for sensing in NLOS. This has implications for
                  localization, ad-hoc robot networks, and security in
                  multi-robot teams, amongst others. The toolbox is designed for
                  distributed and online deployment on robot platforms using
                  commodity hardware and on-board sensors. We also release

                  line-of-sight (LOS) settings for a multi-robot localization
                  usecase. Empirical results show that the bearing estimation
                  from our toolbox achieves mean accuracy of 5.10 degrees. This
                  leads to a median error of 0.5m and 0.9m for localization in
                  LOS and NLOS settings respectively, in a hardware deployment

                  inverse scattering. In this work we present a phaseless
                  inverse scattering method that can accurately image and
                  reconstruct objects even with these attributes. The
                  reconstruction accuracy obtained under these conditions has
                  not been achieved previously and can therefore open up the
                  area to technologically important applications such as indoor
                  Radio Frequency (RF) and microwave imaging. The novelty of the
                  approach is that it utilizes a high frequency approximation
                  for waves passing through lossy media to provide corrections
                  to the conventional Rytov approximation (RA). We refer to this
                  technique as the Extended Phaseless Rytov Approximation for
                  Low Loss Media (xPRA-LM). Simulation as well as experimental
                  results are provided for indoor RF imaging using phaseless
                  measurements from 2.4 GHz based WiFi nodes. We demonstrate
                  that the approach provides accurate reconstruction of an
                  object up to relative permittivities of $15+j1.5$ for object
                  sizes greater than $20 \lambda$ ($\lambda$ is wavelength
                  inside object). Even at higher relative permittivities of up
                  to $\epsilon_r=77+j 7$, object shape reconstruction remains
                  accurate, however the reconstruction amplitude is less
                  accurate. These results have not been obtained before and can
                  be utilized to achieve the potential of RF and microwave

                  enabling emerging human-computer interaction applications. The
                  corresponding technique has gradually evolved from the
                  classification of multiple activity types to more fine-grained
                  tracking of 3D human poses. However, existing WiFi-based 3D
                  human pose tracking is limited to a set of predefined
                  activities. In this work, we present Winect, a 3D human pose
                  tracking system for free-form activity using commodity WiFi
                  devices. Our system tracks free-form activity by estimating a
                  3D skeleton pose that consists of a set of joints of the human
                  body. In particular, we combine signal separation and joint
                  movement modeling to achieve free-form activity tracking. Our
                  system first identifies the moving limbs by leveraging the
                  two-dimensional angle of arrival of the signals reflected off
                  the human body and separates the entangled signals for each
                  limb. Then, it tracks each limb and constructs a 3D skeleton
                  of the body by modeling the inherent relationship between the
                  movements of the limb and the corresponding joints. Our
                  evaluation results show that Winect is environment-independent
                  and achieves centimeter-level accuracy for free-form activity
                  tracking under various challenging environments including the

                  neural network models trained for recognition with data

                  Specifically, we apply pseudo labeling and consistency

                  produce pseudo labels and align instance feature of the target

                  critical component to achieve this ubiquitous connectivity for
                  a wide range of services, and are composed of terminal devices
                  (i.e., nodes), such as sensors of various types, and wall
                  powered gateway devices, which provide further internet
                  connectivity (e..g, via WiFi). When considering large indoor
                  areas, such as hospitals or industrial scenarios, the mesh
                  must cover a large area, which introduces concerns regarding
                  range and the number of gateways needed and respective wall
                  cabling infrastructure. Solutions for mesh networks
                  implemented over different wireless protocols exist, like the
                  recent Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 5.1. Besides range concerns,
                  choosing which nodes forward data through the mesh has a large

                  our own design, which acts as a range extender by forwarding
                  packets from end nodes to gateways. We present the relay's
                  design and experimentally determine the packet forwarding
                  efficiency for several scenarios and configurations. In the
                  best case, up to 35 \% of the packets transmitted by 11 nodes
                  can be forwarded to a gateway by a single relay under
                  continuous operation. A battery lifetime of 1 year can be
                  achieved with a relay duty cycle of 20 \%.},

                  activity causes unique changes to the channel state
                  information (CSI). Existing WiFi sensing suffers from limited
                  scalability as the system needs to be retrained whenever new
                  activities are added, which cause overheads of data collection
                  and retraining. Cross-domain sensing may fail because the
                  mapping between activities and CSI variations is destroyed
                  when a different environment or user (domain) is involved.
                  This paper proposed a few-shot learning-based WiFi sensing
                  system, named FewSense, which can recognise novel classes in
                  unseen domains with only few samples. Specifically, a feature
                  extractor was pre-trained offline using the source domain
                  data. When the system was applied in the target domain, few
                  samples were used to fine-tune the feature extractor for
                  domain adaptation. Inference was made by computing the cosine
                  similarity. FewSense can further boost the classification
                  accuracy by collaboratively fusing inference from multiple
                  receivers. We evaluated the performance using three public
                  datasets, i.e., SignFi, Widar, and Wiar. The results show that
                  FewSense with five-shot learning recognised novel classes in

                  In this paper, a system is provided to generate featured
                  trajectories by crowd-sourcing smartphone data. Firstly, we
                  propose a more accurate PDR algorithm for the generation of
                  trajectory motion data. This algorithm uses ADAPTIV as the
                  step counting method and uses the step estimation algorithm o
                  make the trajectory more accurate in length. Next, the
                  barometer is used to segment the tracks of different floors,
                  and the track floors are obtained by WiFi feature clustering.
                  Finally, by finding the turning point as the feature point of
                  the trajectory, the vertices and edges of the trajectory are

  abstract =     {Owing to the plentiful information released by the commodity
                  devices, WiFi signals have been widely studied for various
                  wireless sensing applications. In many works, both received
                  signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the channel state
                  information (CSI) are utilized as the key factors for precise
                  sensing. However, the calculation and relationship between
                  RSSI and CSI is not explained in detail. Furthermore, there
                  are few works focusing on the measurement variation of the
                  WiFi signal which impacts the sensing results. In this paper,
                  the relationship between RSSI and CSI is studied in detail and
                  the measurement variation of amplitude and phase information
                  is investigated by extensive experiments. In the experiments,
                  transmitter and receiver are directly connected by power
                  divider and RF cables and the signal transmission is
                  quantitatively controlled by RF attenuators. By changing the
                  intensity of attenuation, the measurement of RSSI and CSI is
                  carried out under different conditions. From the results, it
                  is found that in order to get a reliable measurement of the
                  signal amplitude and phase by commodity WiFi, the attenuation
                  of the channels should not exceed 60 dB. Meanwhile, the
                  difference between two channels should be lower than 10 dB. An
                  active control mechanism is suggested to ensure the
                  measurement stability. The findings and criteria of this work
                  is promising to facilitate more precise sensing technologies
                  with WiFi signal.},

                  number of recent studies consider WiFi for sensing. In
                  particular, wireless signals are altered (e.g., reflected and
                  attenuated) by the human body and objects in the environment.
                  This can be perceived by an observer to infer information on
                  human activities or changes in the environment and, hence, to
                  "see" over WiFi. Until now, works on WiFi-based sensing have
                  resulted in a set of custom software tools - each designed for
                  a specific purpose. Moreover, given how scattered the
                  literature is, it is difficult to even identify all
                  steps/functions necessary to build a basic system for
                  WiFi-based sensing. This has led to a high entry barrier,
                  hindering further research in this area. There has been no
                  effort to integrate these tools or to build a general software

                  a promising solution in applications such as smart living and
                  remote monitoring due to the pervasive and unobtrusive nature
                  of WiFi signals. However, the efficacy of WiFi signals is
                  prone to be influenced by the change in the ambient
                  environment and varies over different sub-carriers. To remedy
                  this issue, we propose an end-to-end Gabor residual
                  anti-aliasing sensing network (GraSens) to directly recognize
                  the actions using the WiFi signals from the wireless devices
                  in diverse scenarios. In particular, a new Gabor residual
                  block is designed to address the impact of the changing
                  surrounding environment with a focus on learning reliable and
                  robust temporal-frequency representations of WiFi signals. In
                  each block, the Gabor layer is integrated with the
                  anti-aliasing layer in a residual manner to gain the
                  shift-invariant features. Furthermore, fractal temporal and
                  frequency self-attention are proposed in a joint effort to
                  explicitly concentrate on the efficacy of WiFi signals and
                  thus enhance the quality of output features scattered in
                  different subcarriers. Experimental results throughout our
                  wireless-vision action recognition dataset (WVAR) and three

                  sensing have emerged as a new paradigm since it is convenient
                  and not restricted in the environment. In this paper, a new
                  WiFi-based and video-based neural network (WiNN) is proposed
                  to improve the robustness of activity recognition where the
                  synchronized video serves as the supplement for the wireless

                  videos are captured by cameras. To learn robust gait
                  information, we propose a Lightweight Residual Convolution
                  Network (LRCN) as the backbone network, and further propose
                  the two-stream GaitFi by integrating WiFi and vision features
                  for the gait retrieval task. The GaitFi is trained by the
                  triplet loss and classification loss on different levels of
                  features. Extensive experiments are conducted in the real
                  world, which demonstrates that the GaitFi outperforms
                  state-of-the-art gait recognition methods based on single WiFi

                  knowledge, this is the first time such comprehensive attention
                  mechanism is applied to solve RF fingerprinting problem. In
                  this paper, we resort to real-world IoT WiFi and Bluetooth
                  (BT) emissions (instead of synthetic waveform generation) in a
                  rich multipath and unavoidable interference environment in an
                  indoor experimental testbed. We show the impact of the
                  time-frame of capture by including waveforms collected over a
                  span of months and demonstrate the same time-frame and
                  multiple time-frame fingerprinting evaluations. The
                  effectiveness of resorting to a multi-task architecture is
                  also experimentally proven by conducting single-task and
                  multi-task model analyses. Finally, we demonstrate the

                  state-of-the-art model for fingerprinting. Specifically, we
                  report performance improvements by up to 59.3 \% and 4.91x
                  under single-task WiFi and BT fingerprinting respectively, and
                  up to 50.5 \% increase in fingerprinting accuracy under the

                  systems. While most of these SLAM systems use Visual and LiDAR

                  sensors drift over time. To combat this drift, Visual SLAM

                  State Information (CSI) has received great attention in recent
                  years. However, CSI-based sensing systems suffer from
                  performance degradation when deployed in different
                  environments. Existing works solve this problem by domain
                  adaptation using massive unlabeled high-quality data from the
                  new environment, which is usually unavailable in practice. In
                  this paper, we propose a novel augmented environment-invariant
                  robust WiFi gesture recognition system named AirFi that deals
                  with the issue of environment dependency from a new
                  perspective. The AirFi is a novel domain generalization
                  framework that learns the critical part of CSI regardless of
                  different environments and generalizes the model to unseen
                  scenarios, which does not require collecting any data for
                  adaptation to the new environment. AirFi extracts the common
                  features from several training environment settings and
                  minimizes the distribution differences among them. The feature
                  is further augmented to be more robust to environments.
                  Moreover, the system can be further improved by few-shot
                  learning techniques. Compared to state-of-the-art methods,
                  AirFi is able to work in different environment settings
                  without acquiring any CSI data from the new environment. The
                  experimental results demonstrate that our system remains
                  robust in the new environment and outperforms the compared

  abstract =     {WiFi-based indoor localization has now matured for over a
                  decade. Most of the current localization algorithms rely on
                  the WiFi access points (APs) in the enterprise network to
                  localize the WiFi user accurately. Thus, the WiFi user's
                  location information could be easily snooped by an attacker
                  listening through a compromised WiFi AP. With indoor
                  localization and navigation being the next step towards
                  automation, it is important to give users the capability to
                  defend against such attacks. In this paper, we present MIRAGE,
                  a system that can utilize the downlink physical layer
                  information to create a defense against an attacker snooping
                  on a WiFi user's location information. MIRAGE achieves this by
                  utilizing the beamforming capability of the transmitter that
                  is already part of the WiFi protocols. With this initial idea,
                  we have demonstrated that the user can obfuscate his/her
                  location from the WiFi AP always with no compromise to the
                  throughput of the existing WiFi communication system and
                  reduce the user location accuracy of the attacker from 2.3m to
                  more than 10m.},

                  and almost-universal approach, in contrast to outdoor
                  environments where GPS is dominant. Recently, machine learning
                  (ML) has emerged as the most promising approach for achieving
                  accurate indoor localization, yet its main challenge is the
                  requirement for large datasets to train the neural networks.
                  The data collection procedure is costly and laborious as the
                  procedure requires extensive measurements and labeling
                  processes for different indoor environments. The situation can
                  be improved by Data Augmentation (DA), which is a general
                  framework to enlarge the datasets for ML, making ML systems
                  more robust and increases their generalization capabilities.
                  In this paper, we propose two simple yet surprisingly
                  effective DA algorithms for channel state information (CSI)
                  based indoor localization motivated by physical
                  considerations. We show that the required number of
                  measurements for a given accuracy requirement may be decreased
                  by an order of magnitude. Specifically, we demonstrate the
                  algorithms' effectiveness by experiments conducted with a
                  measured indoor WiFi measurement dataset: as little as 10 \%
                  of the original dataset size is enough to get the same
                  performance of the original dataset. We also showed that, if
                  we further augment the dataset with proposed techniques we get
                  better test accuracy more than three-fold.},

                  pose estimation from images is adversely affected by occlusion
                  and lighting, which are common in many scenarios of interest.
                  Radar and LiDAR technologies, on the other hand, need
                  specialized hardware that is expensive and power-intensive.
                  Furthermore, placing these sensors in non-public areas raises
                  significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations,
                  recent research has explored the use of WiFi antennas (1D
                  sensors) for body segmentation and key-point body detection.
                  This paper further expands on the use of the WiFi signal in
                  combination with deep learning architectures, commonly used in
                  computer vision, to estimate dense human pose correspondence.
                  We developed a deep neural network that maps the phase and

                  AoA) of the WiFi signal reflections to enable WiFi devices to

                  Experimental evaluation under various indoor environments

                  of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential.
                  Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this
                  paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine
                  learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go
                  beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and
                  identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal
                  machine learning, namely: representation, translation,
                  alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will
                  enable researchers to better understand the state of the field
                  and identify directions for future research.},

                  packets received from unauthorized WiFi devices outside of

                  on wireless communication standards. In a common industrial
                  scenario, indoor wireless IoT devices communicate with access
                  points to deliver data collected from industrial sensors,
                  robots and factory machines. Due to static or quasi-static
                  locations of IoT devices and access points, historical
                  observations of IoT device channel conditions provide a
                  possibility to precisely identify the device without observing
                  its traditional identifiers (e.g., MAC or IP address). Such
                  device identification methods based on wireless fingerprinting
                  gained increased attention lately as an additional
                  cyber-security mechanism for critical IoT infrastructures. In
                  this paper, we perform a systematic study of a large class of

                  wireless network (e.g., WiFi, 4G/5G) with the augmented

  abstract =     {Fine-grained person perception such as body segmentation and
                  pose estimation has been achieved with many 2D and 3D sensors
                  such as RGB/depth cameras, radars (e.g., RF-Pose) and LiDARs.
                  These sensors capture 2D pixels or 3D point clouds of person
                  bodies with high spatial resolution, such that the existing
                  Convolutional Neural Networks can be directly applied for
                  perception. In this paper, we take one step forward to show
                  that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D
                  sensors: WiFi antennas. To our knowledge, this is the first
                  work to perceive persons with pervasive WiFi devices, which is
                  cheaper and power efficient than radars and LiDARs, invariant
                  to illumination, and has little privacy concern comparing to
                  cameras. We used two sets of off-the-shelf WiFi antennas to
                  acquire signals, i.e., one transmitter set and one receiver
                  set. Each set contains three antennas lined-up as a regular
                  household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a
                  transmitter antenna, penetrates through and reflects on human
                  bodies, furniture and walls, and then superposes at a receiver
                  antenna as a 1D signal sample (instead of 2D pixels or 3D
                  point clouds). We developed a deep learning approach that uses
                  annotations on 2D images, takes the received 1D WiFi signals
                  as inputs, and performs body segmentation and pose estimation
                  in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on over 100000
                  frames under 16 indoor scenes demonstrate that Person-in-WiFi
                  achieved person perception comparable to approaches using 2D
                  images.},

  abstract =     {In Bora et al. (2017), a mathematical framework was developed
                  for compressed sensing guarantees in the setting where the
                  measurement matrix is Gaussian and the signal structure is the
                  range of a generative neural network (GNN). The problem of
                  compressed sensing with GNNs has since been extensively
                  analyzed when the measurement matrix and/or network weights
                  follow a subgaussian distribution. We move beyond the
                  subgaussian assumption, to measurement matrices that are
                  derived by sampling uniformly at random rows of a unitary
                  matrix (including subsampled Fourier measurements as a special
                  case). Specifically, we prove the first known restricted
                  isometry guarantee for generative compressed sensing with
                  subsampled isometries and provide recovery bounds, addressing
                  an open problem of Scarlett et al. (2022, p. 10). Recovery
                  efficacy is characterized by the coherence, a new parameter,
                  which measures the interplay between the range of the network
                  and the measurement matrix. Our approach relies on subspace
                  counting arguments and ideas central to high-dimensional
                  probability. Furthermore, we propose a regularization strategy
                  for training GNNs to have favourable coherence with the
                  measurement operator. We provide compelling numerical
                  simulations that support this regularized training strategy:
                  our strategy yields low coherence networks that require fewer
                  measurements for signal recovery. This, together with our
                  theoretical results, supports coherence as a natural quantity
                  for characterizing generative compressed sensing with
                  subsampled isometries.},

                  characteristics). However, the literature lacks a systematic
                  understanding of the privacy vulnerabilities of wireless
                  sensing and the defenses against them. In this work, we aim to
                  bridge this gap. First, we propose a framework to systematize
                  wireless sensing-based inference attacks. Our framework
                  consists of three key steps: deploying a sniffing device,
                  sniffing wireless signals, and inferring private information.
                  Our framework can be used to guide the design of new inference
                  attacks since different attacks can instantiate these three
                  steps differently. Second, we propose a defense-in-depth
                  framework to systematize defenses against such inference
                  attacks. The prevention component of our framework aims to
                  prevent inference attacks via obfuscating the wireless signals
                  around a human, while the detection component aims to detect
                  and respond to attacks. Third, based on our attack and defense
                  frameworks, we identify gaps in the existing literature and
                  discuss future research directions.},

                  exactly the same message, using the same protocol? The
                  opportunity for doing so arises due to subtle nonlinear
                  variations across transmitters, even those made by the same
                  manufacturer. Since these effects are difficult to model
                  explicitly, we investigate learning device fingerprints using
                  complex-valued deep neural networks (DNNs) that take as input
                  the complex baseband signal at the receiver. We ask whether
                  such fingerprints can be made robust to distribution shifts
                  across time and locations due to clock drift and variations in
                  the wireless channel. In this paper, we point out that, unless

                  confounding features rather than the nonlinear device-specific
                  characteristics that we seek to learn. We propose and evaluate

                  generalization across realizations of these confounding
                  factors, using data from WiFi and ADS-B protocols. We conclude
                  that, while DNN training has the advantage of not requiring
                  explicit signal models, significant modeling insights are
                  required to focus the learning on the effects we wish to

  abstract =     {This paper explores the use of ambient radio frequency (RF)
                  signals for human presence detection through deep learning.
                  Using WiFi signal as an example, we demonstrate that the
                  channel state information (CSI) obtained at the receiver
                  contains rich information about the propagation environment.
                  Through judicious pre-processing of the estimated CSI followed
                  by deep learning, reliable presence detection can be achieved.
                  Several challenges in passive RF sensing are addressed. With
                  presence detection, how to collect training data with human
                  presence can have a significant impact on the performance.
                  This is in contrast to activity detection when a specific
                  motion pattern is of interest. A second challenge is that RF
                  signals are complex-valued. Handling complex-valued input in
                  deep learning requires careful data representation and network
                  architecture design. Finally, human presence affects CSI
                  variation along multiple dimensions; such variation, however,
                  is often masked by system impediments such as timing or
                  frequency offset. Addressing these challenges, the proposed
                  learning system uses pre-processing to preserve human motion
                  induced channel variation while insulating against other
                  impairments. A convolutional neural network (CNN) properly
                  trained with both magnitude and phase information is then
                  designed to achieve reliable presence detection. Extensive
                  experiments are conducted. Using off-the-shelf WiFi devices,
                  the proposed deep learning based RF sensing achieves near
                  perfect presence detection during multiple extended periods of
                  test and exhibits superior performance compared with leading
                  edge passive infrared sensors. Comparison with existing RF
                  based human presence detection also demonstrates its
                  robustness in performance, especially when deployed in a
                  completely new environment.},

                  can be used to verify the identity of transmitters and assist
                  in implementing an authentication and authorization system.
                  Most recently, there has been wide interest in using deep
                  learning for transmitter identification. However, the existing
                  deep learning work has posed the problem as closed set
                  classification, where a neural network classifies among a
                  finite set of known transmitters. No matter how large this set
                  is, it will not include all transmitters that exist. Malicious
                  transmitters outside this closed set, once within
                  communications range, can jeopardize the system security. In
                  this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for
                  transmitter authorization based on open set recognition. Our
                  proposed approach identifies a set of authorized transmitters,
                  while rejecting any other unseen transmitters by recognizing
                  their signals as outliers. We propose three approaches for
                  this problem and show their ability to reject signals from
                  unauthorized transmitters on a dataset of WiFi captures. We
                  consider the structure of training data needed, and we show
                  that the accuracy improves by having signals from known
                  unauthorized transmitters in the training set.},

                  Conventional approaches based on computer vision are limited

                  system is free of visual limitations and instantly deployable,

                  First, we propose an angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation

                  for positioning. Second, we formulate a WiFi-inertial sensor

  abstract =     {Eating is a fundamental activity in people's daily life.
                  Studies have shown that many health-related problems such as
                  obesity, diabetes and anemia are closely associated with
                  people's unhealthy eating habits (e.g., skipping meals, eating
                  irregularly and overeating). Traditional eating monitoring
                  solutions relying on self-reports remain an onerous task,
                  while the recent trend requiring users to wear expensive
                  dedicated hardware is still invasive. To overcome these
                  limitations, in this paper, we develop a device-free eating
                  monitoring system using WiFi-enabled devices (e.g., smartphone
                  or laptop). Our system aims to automatically monitor users'
                  eating activities through identifying the fine-grained eating
                  motions and detecting the chewing and swallowing. In
                  particular, our system extracts the fine-grained Channel State
                  Information (CSI) from WiFi signals to distinguish eating from
                  non-eating activities and further recognizing users' detailed
                  eating motions with different utensils (e.g., using a folk,
                  knife, spoon or bare hands). Moreover, the system has the
                  capability of identifying chewing and swallowing through
                  detecting users' minute facial muscle movements based on the
                  derived CSI spectrogram. Such fine-grained eating monitoring
                  results are beneficial to the understanding of the user's
                  eating behaviors and can be used to estimate food intake types
                  and amounts. Extensive experiments with 20 users over
                  1600-minute eating show that the proposed system can recognize
                  the user's eating motions with up to 95 \% accuracy and
                  estimate the chewing and swallowing amount with 10 \%
                  percentage error.},

                  plausible modality for sensing different human vital signs,
                  i.e. respiration and body motion, as a function of modulated
                  wireless signals that travel between WiFi devices. Although a
                  remarkable proposition, most of the existing research in this
                  space struggles to withstand robust performance beyond
                  experimental conditions. To this end, we take a careful look
                  at the dynamics of WiFi signals under human respiration and
                  body motions in the wild. We first characterize the WiFi
                  signal components - multipath and signal subspace - that are
                  modulated by human respiration and body motions. We
                  extrapolate on a set of transformations, including first-order
                  differentiation, max-min normalization and component
                  projections, that faithfully explains and quantifies the
                  dynamics of respiration and body motions on WiFi signals.
                  Grounded in this characterization, we propose two methods: 1)
                  a respiration tracking technique that models the peak dynamics
                  observed in the time-varying signal subspaces and 2) a

                  correlation between human body movements and the reflected
                  WiFi signals to classify different activities. By analyzing
                  WiFi signal patterns, especially the dynamics of channel state
                  information (CSI), different activities can be distinguished.
                  Gathering CSI data is expensive both from the timing and
                  equipment perspective. In this paper, we use synthetic data to
                  reduce the need for real measured CSI. We present a
                  semi-supervised learning method for CSI-based activity
                  recognition systems in which long short-term memory (LSTM) is
                  employed to learn features and recognize seven different
                  actions. We apply principal component analysis (PCA) on CSI
                  amplitude data, while short-time Fourier transform (STFT)
                  extracts the features in the frequency domain. At first, we
                  train the LSTM network with entirely raw CSI data, which takes
                  much more processing time. To this end, we aim to generate
                  data by using 50 \% of raw data in conjunction with a
                  generative adversarial network (GAN). Our experimental results
                  confirm that this model can increase classification accuracy
                  by 3.4 \% and reduce the Log loss by almost 16 \% in the
                  considered scenario.},

                  built on fiber and Millimeter-wave (mmWave) links, integrates
                  a communication network with radio terminals (WiFi, ITS-G5,
                  C-V2X, 5G and LoRa(WAN)), multiprotocol, spread throughout 44
                  connected points of access in the city. Additionally, public
                  transportation has also been equipped with communication and
                  sensing units. All these points combine and interconnect a set
                  of sensors, such as mobility (Radars, Lidars, video cameras)
                  and environmental sensors. Combining edge computing and cloud
                  management to deploy the services and manage the platform, and
                  a data platform to gather and process the data, the living lab
                  supports a wide range of services and applications: IoT,
                  intelligent transportation systems and assisted driving,
                  environmental monitoring, emergency and safety, among others.

  abstract =     {Empowered by deep neural networks (DNNs), WiFi fingerprinting
                  has recently achieved astonishing localization performance to
                  facilitate many security-critical applications in wireless
                  networks, but it is inevitably exposed to adversarial attacks,
                  where subtle perturbations can mislead DNNs to wrong
                  predictions. Such vulnerability provides new security breaches
                  to malicious devices for hampering wireless network security,
                  such as malfunctioning geofencing or asset management. The
                  prior adversarial attack on localization DNNs uses additive
                  perturbations on channel state information (CSI) measurements,
                  which is impractical in WiFi transmissions. To transcend this
                  limitation, this paper presents FooLoc, which fools WiFi CSI
                  fingerprinting DNNs over the realistic wireless channel
                  between the attacker and the victim access point (AP). We
                  observe that though uplink CSIs are unknown to the attacker,
                  the accessible downlink CSIs could be their reasonable
                  substitutes at the same spot. We thoroughly investigate the
                  multiplicative and repetitive properties of over-the-air
                  perturbations and devise an efficient optimization problem to
                  generate imperceptible yet robust adversarial perturbations.
                  We implement FooLoc using commercial WiFi APs and Wireless
                  Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) v3 boards in offline and
                  online experiments, respectively. The experimental results
                  show that FooLoc achieves overall attack success rates of
                  about 70 \% in targeted attacks and of above 90 \% in
                  untargeted attacks with small perturbation-to-signal ratios of
                  about -18dB.},

                  relying on shared mobility (e.g., Uber, Lyft) drivers to pick
                  up for transportation. However, such drivers and riders have
                  difficulties finding each other in urban areas as GPS signals
                  get blocked by skyscrapers, in crowded environments (e.g., in
                  stadiums, airports, and bars), at night, and in bad weather.
                  It wastes their time, creates a bad user experience, and
                  causes more CO2 emissions due to idle driving. In this work,
                  we explore the potential of WiFi to help drivers to determine
                  the street side of the riders. Our proposed system is called
                  CarFi that uses WiFi CSI from two antennas placed inside a
                  moving vehicle and a data-driven technique to determine the
                  street side of the rider. By collecting real-world data in
                  realistic and challenging settings by blocking the signal with
                  other people and other parked cars, we see that CarFi is 95.44
                  \% accurate in rider-side determination in both line of sight
                  (LoS) and non-line of sight (nLoS) conditions, and can be run

                  ratios to distinguish mobile people and vacancy of a room,
                  respectively. Furthermore, supervised contrastive learning is
                  conceived to retrieve substantial representations, where
                  consultation loss is formulated to differentiate the
                  representative distances between dynamic and stationery cases.
                  Furthermore, a self-switched static feature enhanced
                  classifier (S3FEC) is proposed to determine the utilization of
                  either RPs or coloring CSI ratio. Finally, comprehensive
                  experimental results have revealed that our proposed CRONOS
                  outperforms the existing systems applying machine learning,
                  non-learning based methods as well as non-CSI based features
                  in open literature, which achieves the highest presence
                  detection accuracy and moderate computational complexity in
                  vacancy, mobility, LoS and NLoS scenarios.},

                  large-scale indoor localization due to its major advantage of
                  not requiring new infrastructure and dedicated devices. The
                  number and the distribution of Reference Points (RPs) for the
                  measurement of localization fingerprints like RSSI during the
                  offline phase, however, greatly affects the localization
                  accuracy; for instance, the UJIIndoorLoc is known to have the
                  issue of uneven spatial distribution of RPs over buildings and
                  floors. Data augmentation has been proposed as a feasible
                  solution to not only improve the smaller number and the uneven
                  distribution of RPs in the existing fingerprint databases but
                  also reduce the labor and time costs of constructing new
                  fingerprint databases. In this paper, we propose the
                  multidimensional augmentation of fingerprint data for indoor
                  localization in a large-scale building complex based on
                  Multi-Output Gaussian Process (MOGP) and systematically
                  investigate the impact of augmentation ratio as well as MOGP
                  kernel functions and models with their hyperparameters on the
                  performance of indoor localization using the UJIIndoorLoc
                  database and the state-of-the-art neural network indoor
                  localization model based on a hierarchical RNN. The
                  investigation based on experimental results suggests that we
                  can generate synthetic RSSI fingerprint data up to ten times
                  the original data -- i.e., the augmentation ratio of 10 --
                  through the proposed multidimensional MOGP-based data
                  augmentation without significantly affecting the indoor
                  localization performance compared to that of the original data
                  alone, which extends the spatial coverage of the combined RPs
                  and thereby could improve the localization performance at the
                  locations that are not part of the test dataset.},

                  management planes. Media access control (MAC) is a function of
                  the data link layer, and thus the MAC protocols involve of
                  both the data and control planes. However, although the

                  interference depends on number of nodes in the network and the

                  Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measurements of
                  either WiFi or Bluetooth-Low-Energy (BLE) beacons. In such

                  convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory
                  (LSTM) quantifier for WiFi fingerprinting indoor localization.
                  In contrast to conventional methods that utilize only spatial
                  data with classification models, our CNN-LSTM network extracts
                  both space and time features of the received channel state
                  information (CSI) from a single router. Furthermore, the
                  proposed network builds a quantification model rather than a
                  limited classification model as in most of the literature
                  work, which enables the estimation of testing points that are
                  not identical to the reference points. We analyze the
                  instability of CSI and demonstrate a mitigation solution using
                  a comprehensive filter and normalization scheme. The
                  localization accuracy is investigated through extensive

                  mobile phone (Nexus 5) and laptop (Intel 5300 NIC) on hundreds
                  of testing locations. Using only a single WiFi router, our
                  structure achieves an average localization error of 2.5~m with
                  $\mathrm{80\%}$ of the errors under 4~m, which outperforms the
                  other reported algorithms by approximately $\mathrm{50\%}$

                  strategies to prevent the spread of pandemics such as
                  COVID-19. Recently, several efforts have been initiated to
                  track individuals, their movements, and interactions using
                  technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records,
                  and smartphone applications. Such solutions are often
                  intrusive, potentially violating individual privacy rights and
                  are often subject to regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPR) that
                  mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use
                  personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a
                  system that empowers organizations to observe individuals and
                  spaces to implement policies for social distancing and contact
                  tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive and
                  privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of
                  employees and occupants at an organization, while protecting
                  the privacy of all parties. Quest incorporates
                  computationally- and information-theoretically-secure
                  protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of
                  an individual's location history (based on WiFi data); it
                  includes support for accurately identifying users who were in
                  the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then informing them
                  via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of
                  privacy-enabled applications to ensure adherence to social
                  distancing, monitor the flow of people through spaces,
                  identify potentially impacted regions, and raise exposure
                  alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and
                  implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in
                  Quest. We, also, validate the practicality of Quest and

                  signals can be used to verify their identity in an
                  authorization system. While deep learning was proposed for
                  transmitter identification, the majority of the work has
                  focused on classification among a closed set of transmitters.
                  Malicious transmitters outside this closed set will be
                  misclassified, jeopardizing the authorization system. In this
                  paper, we consider the problem of recognizing authorized
                  transmitters and rejecting new transmitters. To address this
                  problem, we adapt the most prominent approaches from the open
                  set recognition and anomaly detection literature to the
                  problem. We study how these approaches scale with the required
                  number of authorized transmitters. We propose using a known
                  set of unauthorized transmitters to assist the training and
                  study its impact. The evaluation procedure takes into
                  consideration that some transmitters might be more similar
                  than others and nuances these effects. The robustness of the
                  RF authorization with respect to temporal changes in
                  fingerprints is also considered in the evaluation. When using
                  10 authorized and 50 known unauthorized WiFi transmitters from
                  a publicly accessible testbed, we were able to achieve an
                  outlier detection accuracy of 98 \% on the same day test set
                  and 80 \% on the different day test set.},

                  different from the usual Euclidean geometry. Naively applying
                  traditional smoothing methods such as Euclidean Gaussian
                  Processes (GPs) to manifold valued data and so ignoring the
                  geometry of the space can potentially lead to highly
                  misleading predictions and inferences. A manifold embedded in
                  a high dimensional Euclidean space can be well described by a
                  probabilistic mapping function and the corresponding latent
                  space. We investigate the geometrical structure of the unknown
                  manifolds using the Bayesian Gaussian Processes latent
                  variable models(BGPLVM) and Riemannian geometry. The
                  distribution of the metric tensor is learned using BGPLVM. The
                  boundary of the resulting manifold is defined based on the
                  uncertainty quantification of the mapping. We use the the
                  probabilistic metric tensor to simulate Brownian Motion paths
                  on the unknown manifold. The heat kernel is estimated as the
                  transition density of Brownian Motion and used as the
                  covariance functions of GPUM. The applications of GPUM are
                  illustrated in the simulation studies on the Swiss roll, high
                  dimensional real datasets of WiFi signals and image data
                  examples. Its performance is compared with the Graph Laplacian
                  GP, Graph Matern GP and Euclidean GP.},

  abstract =     {Recently, the research of wireless sensing has achieved more
                  intelligent results, and the intelligent sensing of human
                  location and activity can be realized by means of WiFi
                  devices. However, most of the current human environment
                  perception work is limited to a single person's environment,
                  because the environment in which multiple people exist is more
                  complicated than the environment in which a single person
                  exists. In order to solve the problem of human behavior
                  perception in a multi-human environment, we first proposed a
                  solution to achieve crowd counting (inferred population) using
                  deep learning in a closed environment with WIFI signals -
                  DeepCout, which is the first in a multi-human environment.
                  step. Since the use of WiFi to directly count the crowd is too
                  complicated, we use deep learning to solve this problem, use
                  Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to automatically extract the
                  relationship between the number of people and the channel, and
                  use Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) to resolve the dependencies
                  of number of people and Channel State Information(CSI) . To
                  overcome the massive labelled data required by deep learning
                  method, we add an online learning mechanism to determine
                  whether or not someone is entering/leaving the room by
                  activity recognition model, so as to correct the deep learning
                  model in the fine-tune stage, which, in turn, reduces the
                  required training data and make our method evolving over time.
                  The system of DeepCount is performed and evaluated on the
                  commercial WiFi devices. By massive training samples, our
                  end-to-end learning approach can achieve an average of 86.4 \%
                  prediction accuracy in an environment of up to 5 people.
                  Meanwhile, by the amendment mechanism of the activity
                  recognition model to judge door switch to get the variance of
                  crowd to amend deep learning predicted results, the accuracy
                  is up to 90 \%.},

  abstract =     {Counting the number of people inside a building, from outside
                  and without entering the building, is crucial for many
                  applications. In this paper, we are interested in counting the
                  total number of people walking inside a building (or in
                  general behind walls), using readily-deployable WiFi
                  transceivers that are installed outside the building, and only
                  based on WiFi RSSI measurements. The key observation of the
                  paper is that the inter-event times, corresponding to the dip
                  events of the received signal, are fairly robust to the
                  attenuation through walls (for instance as compared to the
                  exact dip values). We then propose a methodology that can
                  extract the total number of people from the inter-event times.
                  More specifically, we first show how to characterize the
                  wireless received power measurements as a superposition of
                  renewal-type processes. By borrowing theories from the
                  renewal-process literature, we then show how the probability
                  mass function of the inter-event times carries vital
                  information on the number of people. We validate our framework
                  with 44 experiments in five different areas on our campus (3
                  classrooms, a conference room, and a hallway), using only one
                  WiFi transmitter and receiver installed outside of the
                  building, and for up to and including 20 people. Our
                  experiments further include areas with different wall
                  materials, such as concrete, plaster, and wood, to validate
                  the robustness of the proposed approach. Overall, our results
                  show that our approach can estimate the total number of people
                  behind the walls with a high accuracy while minimizing the
                  need for prior calibrations.},

                  crowd speed using WiFi devices without relying on people to
                  carry any device. Our approach not only enables speed
                  estimation in the region where WiFi links are, but also in the
                  adjacent possibly WiFi-free regions. More specifically, we use
                  a pair of WiFi links in one region, whose RSSI measurements
                  are then used to estimate the crowd speed, not only in this
                  region, but also in adjacent WiFi-free regions. We first prove
                  how the cross-correlation and the probability of crossing the
                  two links implicitly carry key information about the
                  pedestrian speeds and develop a mathematical model to relate
                  them to pedestrian speeds. We then validate our approach with
                  108 experiments, in both indoor and outdoor, where up to 10
                  people walk in two adjacent areas, with variety of speeds per
                  region, showing that our framework can accurately estimate
                  these speeds with only a pair of WiFi links in one region. For
                  instance, the NMSE over all experiments is 0.18. We also
                  evaluate our framework in a museum-type setting and estimate
                  the popularity of different exhibits. We finally run
                  experiments in an aisle in Costco, estimating key attributes
                  of buyers' behaviors.},

                  Crowd Counting Via Few-Shot Learning},

  abstract =     {Accurate indoor crowd counting (ICC) is a key enabler to many
                  smart home/office applications. In this paper, we propose a
                  Domain-Agnostic and Sample-Efficient wireless indoor crowd
                  Counting (DASECount) framework that suffices to attain robust
                  cross-domain detection accuracy given very limited data
                  samples in new domains. DASECount leverages the wisdom of
                  few-shot learning (FSL) paradigm consisting of two major
                  stages: source domain meta training and target domain meta
                  testing. Specifically, in the meta-training stage, we design
                  and train two separate convolutional neural network (CNN)
                  modules on the source domain dataset to fully capture the
                  implicit amplitude and phase features of CSI measurements
                  related to human activities. A subsequent knowledge
                  distillation procedure is designed to iteratively update the
                  CNN parameters for better generalization performance. In the
                  meta-testing stage, we use the partial CNN modules to extract
                  low-dimension features out of the high-dimension input target
                  domain CSI data. With the obtained low-dimension CSI features,
                  we can even use very few shots of target domain data samples
                  (e.g., 5-shot samples) to train a lightweight logistic
                  regression (LR) classifier, and attain very high cross-domain
                  ICC accuracy. Experiment results show that the proposed
                  DASECount method achieves over 92.68\%, and on average 96.37\%
                  detection accuracy in a 0-8 people counting task under various
                  domain setups, which significantly outperforms the other
                  representative benchmark methods considered.},

  abstract =     {In this research we consider an approach for improving the
                  efficiency and tightness of column generation (CG) methods for
                  solving vehicle routing problems. This work builds upon recent
                  work on Local Area (LA) routes. LA routes rely on
                  pre-computing (prior to any call to pricing during CG) the
                  lowest cost elementary sub-route (called an LA arc) for each
                  tuple consisting of the following: (1) a customer to begin the
                  LA arc, (2) a customer to end the LA arc, which is far from
                  the first customer, (3) a small set of intermediate customers
                  nearby the first customer. LA routes are constructed by
                  concatenating LA arcs where the final customer in a given LA
                  arc is the first customer in the subsequent LA arc. A
                  Decremental State Space Relaxation (DSSR) method is used to
                  construct the lowest reduced cost elementary route during the
                  pricing step of CG. We demonstrate that LA route based solvers
                  can be used to efficiently tighten the standard set cover
                  vehicle routing relaxation using a variant of subset row
                  inequalities (SRI). However, SRI are difficult to use in
                  practice as they alter the structure of the pricing problem in
                  a manner that makes pricing difficult. SRI in their simplest
                  form state that the number of routes servicing two or three
                  members of a given set of three customers cannot exceed one.
                  We introduce LA-SRI, which in their simplest form state that
                  the number of LA arcs (in routes in the solution) including
                  two or more members of a set of three customers (excluding the
                  final customer of the arc) cannot exceed one. We exploit the
                  structure of LA arcs inside a Graph Generation based
                  formulation to accelerate convergence of CG. We apply our
                  LA-SRI to CVRP and demonstrate that we tighten the LP
                  relaxation, often making it equal to the optimal integer
                  solution, and solve the LP efficiently without altering the
                  structure of the pricing problem.},

  abstract =     {WiFi-based sensing for human activity recognition (HAR) has
                  recently become a hot topic as it brings great benefits when
                  compared with video-based HAR, such as eliminating the demands
                  of line-of-sight (LOS) and preserving privacy. Making the WiFi
                  signals to 'see' the action, however, is quite coarse and thus
                  still in its infancy. An end-to-end spatiotemporal WiFi signal
                  neural network (STWNN) is proposed to enable WiFi-only sensing
                  in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios.
                  Especially, the 3D convolution module is able to explore the
                  spatiotemporal continuity of WiFi signals, and the feature
                  self-attention module can explicitly maintain dominant
                  features. In addition, a novel 3D representation for WiFi
                  signals is designed to preserve multi-scale spatiotemporal
                  information. Furthermore, a small wireless-vision dataset
                  (WVAR) is synchronously collected to extend the potential of
                  STWNN to 'see' through occlusions. Quantitative and
                  qualitative results on WVAR and the other three public
                  benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
                  approach on both accuracy and shift consistency.},

  abstract =     {Motion tracking systems based on optical sensors typically
                  often suffer from issues, such as poor lighting conditions,
                  occlusion, limited coverage, and may raise privacy concerns.
                  More recently, radio frequency (RF)-based approaches using
                  commercial WiFi devices have emerged which offer low-cost
                  ubiquitous sensing whilst preserving privacy. However, the
                  output of an RF sensing system, such as Range-Doppler
                  spectrograms, cannot represent human motion intuitively and
                  usually requires further processing. In this study, MDPose, a
                  novel framework for human skeletal motion reconstruction based
                  on WiFi micro-Doppler signatures, is proposed. It provides an
                  effective solution to track human activities by reconstructing
                  a skeleton model with 17 key points, which can assist with the
                  interpretation of conventional RF sensing outputs in a more
                  understandable way. Specifically, MDPose has various
                  incremental stages to gradually address a series of
                  challenges: First, a denoising algorithm is implemented to
                  remove any unwanted noise that may affect the feature
                  extraction and enhance weak Doppler signatures. Secondly, the
                  convolutional neural network (CNN)-recurrent neural network
                  (RNN) architecture is applied to learn temporal-spatial
                  dependency from clean micro-Doppler signatures and restore key
                  points' velocity information. Finally, a pose optimising
                  mechanism is employed to estimate the initial state of the
                  skeleton and to limit the increase of error. We have conducted
                  comprehensive tests in a variety of environments using
                  numerous subjects with a single receiver radar system to
                  demonstrate the performance of MDPose, and report 29.4mm mean
                  absolute error over all key points positions, which
                  outperforms state-of-the-art RF-based pose estimation
                  systems.},

  abstract =     {The ever-developing Internet of Things (IoT) brings the
                  prosperity of wireless sensing and control applications. In
                  many scenarios, different wireless technologies coexist in the
                  shared frequency medium as well as the physical space. Such
                  wireless coexistence may lead to serious cross-technology
                  interference (CTI) problems, e.g. channel competition, signal
                  collision, throughput degradation. Compared with traditional
                  methods like interference avoidance, tolerance, and
                  concurrency mechanism, direct and timely information exchange
                  among heterogeneous devices is therefore a fundamental
                  requirement to ensure the usability, inter-operability, and
                  reliability of the IoT. Under this circumstance,
                  Cross-Technology Communication (CTC) technique thus becomes a
                  hot topic in both academic and industrial fields, which aims
                  at directly exchanging data among heterogeneous devices that
                  follow different standards. This paper comprehensively
                  summarizes the CTC techniques and reveals that the key
                  challenge for CTC lies in the heterogeneity of IoT devices,
                  including the incompatibility of technical standards and the
                  asymmetry of connection capability. Based on the above
                  finding, we present a taxonomy of the existing CTC works
                  (packet-level CTCs and physical-level CTCs) and compare the
                  existing CTC techniques in terms of throughput, reliability,
                  hardware modification, and concurrency.},

                  In this paper, we present a broad picture of the motivation,
                  methodologies, challenges, and research opportunities of
                  realizing PMN, by providing a comprehensive survey for systems
                  and technologies developed mainly in the last ten years.
                  Beginning by reviewing the work on coexisting communication
                  and radar systems, we highlight their limits on addressing the
                  interference problem, and then introduce the JCAS technology.
                  We then set up JCAS in the mobile network context and envisage
                  its potential applications. We continue to provide a brief
                  review of three types of JCAS systems, with particular
                  attention to their differences in design philosophy. We then
                  introduce a framework of PMN, including the system platform
                  and infrastructure, three types of sensing operations, and
                  signals usable for sensing. Subsequently, we discuss required
                  system modifications to enable sensing on current
                  communication-only infrastructure. Within the context of PMN,
                  we review stimulating research problems and potential
                  solutions, organized under nine topics: performance bounds,
                  waveform optimization, antenna array design, clutter
                  suppression, sensing parameter estimation, resolution of
                  sensing ambiguity, pattern analysis, networked sensing under
                  cellular topology, and sensing-assisted communications. We
                  conclude the paper by listing key open research problems for
                  the aforementioned topics and sharing some lessons that we
                  have learned.},

                  framework that is more data-efficient than traditional machine
                  learning methods. However, its generalization ability in
                  complex task distributions, such as multimodal tasks, has not
                  been thoroughly studied. Recently, some studies on
                  multimodality-based meta-learning have emerged. This survey
                  provides a comprehensive overview of the multimodality-based
                  meta-learning landscape in terms of the methodologies and
                  applications. We first formalize the definition of
                  meta-learning in multimodality, along with the research
                  challenges in this growing field, such as how to enrich the
                  input in few-shot learning (FSL) or zero-shot learning (ZSL)
                  in multimodal scenarios and how to generalize the models to
                  new tasks. We then propose a new taxonomy to discuss typical
                  meta-learning algorithms in multimodal tasks systematically.
                  We investigate the contributions of related papers and
                  summarize them by our taxonomy. Finally, we propose potential
                  research directions for this promising field.},

  abstract =     {Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been
                  extensively researched in past years particularly with regard
                  to range-based or visual-based sensors. Instead of deploying
                  dedicated devices that use visual features, it is more
                  pragmatic to exploit the radio features to achieve this task,
                  due to their ubiquitous nature and the widespread deployment
                  of WiFi wireless network. This paper presents a novel
                  approach for collaborative simultaneous localization and radio
                  fingerprint mapping (C-SLAM-RF) in large unknown indoor
                  environments. The proposed system uses received signal
                  strengths (RSS) from WiFi access points (AP) in the existing
                  infrastructure and pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) from a
                  smart phone, without a prior knowledge about map or
                  distribution of AP in the environment. We claim a loop closure
                  based on the similarity of the two radio fingerprints. To
                  further improve the performance, we incorporate the turning
                  motion and assign a small uncertainty value to a loop closure
                  if a matched turning is identified. The experiment was done in
                  an area of 130 meters by 70 meters and the results show that
                  our proposed system is capable of estimating the tracks of
                  four users with an accuracy of 0.6 meters with Tango-based PDR
                  and 4.76 meters with a step counter-based PDR.},

                  of crossing a WiFi TX-RX link is directly proportional to the
                  per-step distance and inversely proportional to the lateral
                  dimension of the room. The asymptotic value of the said
                  crossing probability is derived using Perron-Frobenius theory
                  to determine the limit distribution of the said Markov model.

                  explored nearly 300 years ago by Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte
                  de Buffon to get the result. Furthermore we can use the

                  attentions from both academia and industry. However, the
                  overhead of constructing and maintaining the WiFi fingerprint
                  map remains a bottleneck for the wide-deployment of WiFi-based
                  indoor localization systems. Recently, robots are adopted as
                  the professional surveyor to fingerprint the environment
                  autonomously. But the time and energy cost still limit the
                  coverage of the robot surveyor, thus reduce its scalability.
                  To fill this need, we design an AutonomousWiFi Fingerprinting
                  system, called AuF, which autonomously constructs the
                  fingerprint database with time and energy efficiency. AuF
                  first conduct an automatic initialization process in the
                  target indoor environment, then constructs the WiFi
                  fingerprint database of in two steps: (i) surveying the site
                  without sojourn, (ii) recovering unreliable signals in the
                  database with two methods. We have implemented and evaluated
                  AuF using a Pioneer 3-DX robot, on two sites of our
                  $70$$\times$$90$m$^2$ Department building with different
                  structures and deployments of access points (APs). The results
                  show AuF finishes the fingerprint database construction in
                  43/51 minutes, and consumes 60/82 Wh on the two floors
                  respectively, which is a 64 \%/71 \% and 61 \%/64 \% reduction
                  when compared to traditional site survey methods, without
                  degrading the localization accuracy.},

                  indoor localization has attracted lots of attention very
                  recently.The frequency diverse and temporally stable CSI
                  better represents the location dependent channel
                  characteristics than the coarsereceived signal strength (RSS).
                  However, the acquisition of CSI requires the cooperation of
                  access points (APs) and involves only dataframes, which
                  imposes restrictions on real-world deployment. In this paper,
                  we present CRISLoc, the first CSI fingerprinting
                  basedlocalization prototype system using ubiquitous
                  smartphones. CRISLoc operates in a completely passive mode,
                  overhearing thepackets on-the-fly for his own CSI acquisition.
                  The smartphone CSI is sanitized via calibrating the distortion
                  enforced by WiFi amplifiercircuits. CRISLoc tackles the
                  challenge of altered APs with a joint clustering and outlier
                  detection method to find them. A novel transferlearning
                  approach is proposed to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI
                  fingerprint database on the basis of the outdated
                  fingerprintsand a few fresh measurements, and an enhanced KNN
                  approach is proposed to pinpoint the location of a smartphone.
                  Our studyreveals important properties about the stability and
                  sensitivity of smartphone CSI that has not been reported
                  previously. Experimentalresults show that CRISLoc can achieve
                  a mean error of around 0.29m in a6m times 8mresearch
                  laboratory. The mean error increases by 5.4 cm and 8.6 cm upon
                  the movement of one and two APs, which validates the
                  robustness of CRISLoc against environment changes.},

                  mobility patterns and nowadays we are facing an increase in
                  the pervasiveness of mobile devices these individuals carry.
                  Positioning technologies that serve these devices such as the
                  cellular antenna (GSM networks), global navigation satellite
                  systems (GPS), and more recently the WiFi positioning system
                  (WPS) provide large amounts of spatio-temporal data in a
                  continuous way. Therefore, detecting significant places and
                  the frequency of movements between them is fundamental to
                  understand human behavior. In this paper, we propose a method
                  for discovering user habits without any a priori or external
                  knowledge by introducing a density-based clustering for
                  spatio-temporal data to identify meaningful places and by
                  applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) over the set of
                  meaningful places to identify the representations of
                  individual habits. To evaluate the proposed method we use two

                  data and the other one contains GSM mobile phone data in a
                  coarse representation. The results show that the proposed
                  method is suitable for this task as many unique habits were
                  identified. This can be used for understanding users' behavior
                  and to draw their characterizing profiles having a panorama of
                  the mobility patterns from the data.},

  abstract =     {Emotion is well-recognized as a distinguished symbol of human
                  beings, and it plays a crucial role in our daily lives.
                  Existing vision-based or sensor-based solutions are either
                  obstructive to use or rely on specialized hardware, hindering
                  their applicability. This paper introduces EmoSense, a
                  first-of-its-kind wireless emotion sensing system driven by
                  computational intelligence. The basic methodology is to
                  explore the physical expression of emotions from wireless
                  channel response via data mining. The design and
                  implementation of EmoSense {face} two major challenges:
                  extracting physical expression from wireless channel data and
                  recovering emotion from the corresponding physical expression.
                  For the former, we present a Fresnel zone based theoretical
                  model depicting the fingerprint of the physical expression on
                  channel response. For the latter, we design an efficient
                  computational intelligence driven mechanism to recognize
                  emotion from the corresponding fingerprints. We prototyped
                  EmoSense on the commodity WiFi infrastructure and compared it
                  with main-stream sensor-based and vision-based approaches in
                  the real-world scenario. The numerical study over $3360$ cases
                  confirms that EmoSense achieves a comparable performance to
                  the vision-based and sensor-based rivals under different
                  scenarios. EmoSense only leverages the low-cost and prevalent
                  WiFi infrastructures and thus constitutes a tempting solution
                  for emotion sensing.},

  abstract =     {The existing localization systems for indoor applications
                  basically rely on wireless signal. With the massive deployment
                  of low-cost cameras, the visual image based localization
                  become attractive as well. However, in the existing
                  literature, the hybrid visual and wireless approaches simply
                  combine the above schemes in a straight forward manner, and
                  fail to explore the interactions between them. In this paper,
                  we propose a joint visual and wireless signal feature based
                  approach for high-precision indoor localization system. In
                  this joint scheme, WiFi signals are utilized to compute the
                  coarse area with likelihood probability and visual images are
                  used to fine-tune the localization result. Based on the
                  numerical results, we show that the proposed scheme can
                  achieve 0.62m localization accuracy with near real-time
                  running time.},

  abstract =     {Understanding crowd behaviors in a large social event is
                  crucial for event management. Passive WiFi sensing, by
                  collecting WiFi probe requests sent from mobile devices,
                  provides a better way to monitor crowds compared with people
                  counters and cameras in terms of free interference, larger
                  coverage, lower cost, and more information on people's
                  movement. In existing studies, however, not enough attention
                  has been paid to the thorough analysis and mining of collected
                  data. Especially, the power of machine learning has not been
                  fully exploited. In this paper, therefore, we propose a
                  comprehensive data analysis framework to fully analyze the
                  collected probe requests to extract three types of patterns
                  related to crowd behaviors in a large social event, with the
                  help of statistics, visualization, and unsupervised machine
                  learning. First, trajectories of the mobile devices are
                  extracted from probe requests and analyzed to reveal the
                  spatial patterns of the crowds' movement. Hierarchical
                  agglomerative clustering is adopted to find the
                  interconnections between different locations. Next, k-means
                  and k-shape clustering algorithms are applied to extract
                  temporal visiting patterns of the crowds by days and
                  locations, respectively. Finally, by combining with time,
                  trajectories are transformed into spatiotemporal patterns,
                  which reveal how trajectory duration changes over the length
                  and how the overall trends of crowd movement change over time.
                  The proposed data analysis framework is fully demonstrated
                  using real-world data collected in a large social event.
                  Results show that one can extract comprehensive patterns from
                  data collected by a network of passive WiFi sensors.},

                  inertial drifts and unknown initial states in real
                  applications, which renders the estimated trajectories
                  inaccurate and not obtained in a well defined coordinate
                  system for matching trajectories of different users. In this
                  paper, an approach adopting received signal strength (RSS)
                  measurements for Wifi access points (APs) are proposed to
                  align and calibrate the trajectories estimated from foot
                  mounted inertial measurement units (IMUs). A crowd-sourced
                  radio map (RM) can be built subsequently and can be used for
                  fingerprinting based Wifi indoor positioning (FWIP). The
                  foundation of the proposed approach is graph based
                  simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM). The nodes in
                  the graph denote users poses and the edges denote the pairwise
                  constrains between the nodes. The constrains are derived from:
                  (1) inertial estimated trajectories; (2) vicinity in the RSS
                  space. With these constrains, an error functions is defined.
                  By minimizing the error function, the graph is optimized and
                  the aligned/calibrated trajectories along with the RM are
                  acquired. The experimental results have corroborated the
                  effectiveness of the approach for trajectory alignment,

                  representation and analysis. Traditionally estimated thanks to
                  traffic counts, surveys and socio-economic models, recent
                  technological advances permit to rethink the estimation
                  problem. Road user identification technologies, such as
                  connected GPS, Bluetooth or Wifi detectors bring additional
                  information, that is, for a fraction of the users, the origin,
                  the destination and to some extend the itinerary taken. In the
                  present work, this additional information is used for the
                  estimation of a more comprehensive traffic representation
                  tool: the link-origin-destination matrix. Such
                  three-dimensional matrices extend the concept of traditional
                  origin-destination matrices by also giving information on the
                  traffic assignment. Their estimation is solved as an inverse
                  problem whose objective function represents a trade-off
                  between important properties the traffic has to satisfy. This
                  article presents the theory and how to implement such method
                  on real dataset. With the case study of Brisbane City where
                  over 600 hundreds Bluetooth detectors have been installed it
                  also illustrates the opportunities such
                  link-origin-destination matrices create for traffic analysis.},

  abstract =     {As elderly population grows, social and health care begin to
                  face validation challenges, in-home monitoring is becoming a
                  focus for professionals in the field. Governments urgently
                  need to improve the quality of healthcare services at lower
                  costs while ensuring the comfort and independence of the
                  elderly. This work presents an in-home monitoring approach
                  based on off-the-shelf WiFi, which is low-costs, non-wearable
                  and makes all-round daily healthcare information available to
                  caregivers. The proposed approach can capture fine-grained
                  human pose figures even through a wall and track detailed
                  respiration status simultaneously by off-the-shelf WiFi
                  devices. Based on them, behavioral data, physiological data
                  and the derived information (e.g., abnormal events and
                  underlying diseases), of the elderly could be seen by
                  caregivers directly. We design a series of signal processing
                  methods and a neural network to capture human pose figures and
                  extract respiration status curves from WiFi Channel State
                  Information (CSI). Extensive experiments are conducted and
                  according to the results, off-the-shelf WiFi devices are
                  capable of capturing fine-grained human pose figures, similar
                  to cameras, even through a wall and track accurate respiration
                  status, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and feasibility
                  of our approach for in-home monitoring.},

  abstract =     {Most computer vision systems and computational photography
                  systems are visible light based which is a small fraction of
                  the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum. In recent years radio
                  frequency (RF) hardware has become more widely available, for
                  example, many cars are equipped with a RADAR, and almost every
                  home has a WiFi device. In the context of imaging, RF spectrum
                  holds many advantages compared to visible light systems. In
                  particular, in this regime, EM energy effectively interacts in
                  different ways with matter. This property allows for many
                  novel applications such as privacy preserving computer vision
                  and imaging through absorbing and scattering materials in
                  visible light such as walls. Here, we expand many of the
                  concepts in computational photography in visible light to RF
                  cameras. The main limitation of imaging with RF is the large
                  wavelength that limits the imaging resolution when compared to
                  visible light. However, the output of RF cameras is usually
                  processed by computer vision and perception algorithms which
                  would benefit from multi-modal sensing of the environment, and
                  from sensing in situations in which visible light systems
                  fail. To bridge the gap between computational photography and
                  RF imaging, we expand the concept of light-field to RF. This
                  work paves the way to novel computational sensing systems with
                  RF.},

                  using passive WiFi sensing to classify and estimate human
                  respiration activity. A passive radar test-bed is used with
                  two channels where the first channel provides the reference
                  WiFi signal, whereas the other channel provides a surveillance
                  signal that contains reflections from the human target.
                  Adaptive filtering is performed to make the surveillance
                  signal source-data invariant by eliminating the echoes of the
                  direct transmitted signal. We propose a novel convolutional
                  neural network to classify the complex time series data and
                  determine if it corresponds to a breathing activity, followed
                  by a random forest estimator to determine breathing rate. We
                  collect an extensive dataset to train the learning models and
                  develop reference benchmarks for the future studies in the
                  field. Based on the results, we conclude that deep learning
                  techniques coupled with passive radars offer great potential
                  for end-to-end human activity recognition.},

                  normal model, we are able to conditionally formulate a
                  distribution for the missing entries and present a robust
                  framework, which minimizes the worst case error caused by the
                  uncertainty about the missing data. We show that the proposed
                  formulation, which naturally takes into account the dependency
                  between different variables, ultimately reduces to a convex
                  program, for which a customized and scalable solver can be
                  delivered. In addition to a detailed analysis to deliver such
                  solver, we also asymptoticly analyze the behavior of the
                  proposed framework, and present technical discussions to
                  estimate the required input parameters. We complement our
                  analysis with experiments performed on synthetic,
                  semi-synthetic, and real data, and show how the proposed
                  formulation improves the prediction accuracy and robustness,
                  and outperforms the competing techniques. Missing data is a
                  common problem associated with many datasets in machine
                  learning. With the significant increase in using robust
                  optimization techniques to train machine learning models, this
                  paper presents a novel robust regression framework that
                  operates by minimizing the uncertainty associated with missing
                  data. The proposed approach allows training models with
                  incomplete data, while minimizing the impact of uncertainty
                  associated with the unavailable data. The ideas developed in
                  this paper can be generalized beyond linear models and
                  elliptical data distributions.},

  abstract =     {In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman Filter (KF)-based
                  uplink (UL) joint communication and sensing (JCAS) scheme,
                  which can significantly reduce the range and location
                  estimation errors due to the clock asynchronism between the
                  base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). Clock asynchronism
                  causes time-varying time offset (TO) and carrier frequency
                  offset (CFO), leading to major challenges in uplink sensing.
                  Unlike existing technologies, our scheme does not require
                  knowing the location of the UE in advance, and retains the
                  linearity of the sensing parameter estimation problem. We
                  first estimate the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) of multipaths and
                  use them to spatially filter the CSI. Then, we propose a
                  KF-based CSI enhancer that exploits the estimation of Doppler
                  with CFO as the prior information to significantly suppress
                  the time-varying noise-like TO terms in spatially filtered
                  CSIs. Subsequently, we can estimate the accurate ranges of UE
                  and the scatterers based on the KF-enhanced CSI. Finally, we
                  identify the UE's AoA and range estimation and locate UE, then
                  locate the dumb scatterers using the bi-static system.
                  Simulation results validate the proposed scheme. The
                  localization root mean square error of the proposed method is
                  about 20 dB lower than the benchmarking scheme.},

                  been recently considered as a promising technique for beyond
                  5G systems. In ISCC systems, the competition for communication
                  and computation resources between sensing tasks for ambient
                  intelligence and computation tasks from mobile devices becomes
                  an increasingly challenging issue. To address it, we first
                  propose an efficient sensing framework with a novel action
                  detection module. It can reduce the overhead of computation
                  resource by detecting whether the sensing target is static.
                  Subsequently, we analyze the sensing performance of the
                  proposed framework and theoretically prove its effectiveness
                  with the help of the sampling theorem. Then, we formulate a
                  sensing accuracy maximization problem while guaranteeing the
                  quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of tasks. To solve it,
                  we propose an optimal resource allocation strategy, in which
                  the minimal resource is allocated to computation tasks, and
                  the rest is devoted to sensing tasks. Besides, a threshold
                  selection policy is derived. Compared with the conventional
                  schemes, the results further demonstrate the necessity of the
                  proposed sensing framework. Finally, a real-world test of
                  action recognition tasks based on USRP B210 is conducted to
                  verify the sensing performance analysis, and extensive
                  experiments demonstrate the performance improvement of our
                  proposal by comparing it with some benchmark schemes.},

                  have been explored for years in both academy and industry to
                  provide stable and reliable performance in WiFi-based indoor
                  positioning systems. Such algorithms estimate the location of
                  a given point based on the locality information from the
                  selected nearest WiFi neighbors according to some distance
                  metrics calculated from the combination of WiFi received
                  signal strength (RSS). However, such a process does not
                  consider the relational information among the given point,
                  WiFi neighbors, and the WiFi access points (WAPs). Therefore,
                  this study proposes a novel Deep Neighborhood Learning (DNL).
                  The proposed DNL approach converts the WiFi neighborhood to
                  heterogeneous graphs, and utilizes deep graph learning to
                  extract better representation of the WiFi neighborhood to
                  improve the positioning accuracy. Experiments on 3 real
                  industrial datasets collected from 3 mega shopping malls on 26
                  floors have shown that the proposed approach can reduce the
                  mean absolute positioning error by 10 \% to 50 \% in most of
                  the cases. Specially, the proposed approach sharply reduces
                  the root mean squared positioning error and 95\% percentile
                  positioning error, being more robust to the outliers than
                  conventional KNN and WKNN.},

                  devices used every day in our homes and workplaces to ease our
                  lives. Such a strict coexistence between humans and smart
                  devices makes the latter digital witnesses of our every-day
                  lives through their sensor systems. This opens up to a new
                  area of digital investigation named IoT Forensics, where
                  digital traces produced by smart devices (network traffic, in
                  primis) are leveraged as evidences for forensic purposes. It
                  is therefore important to create tools able to capture, store
                  and possibly analyse easily such digital traces to ease the
                  job of forensic investigators. This work presents one of such

                  WiFi enabled smart devices used in Smart Building/Smart Home

                  classification from encrypted traffic produced by IoT cameras.

                  game-changing applications in many fields, such as healthcare,
                  security, and entertainment. However, despite one decade of
                  active research on WiFi sensing, most existing work only
                  considers legacy IEEE 802.11n devices, often in particular and
                  strictly-controlled environments. Worse yet, there is a
                  fundamental lack of understanding of the impact on CSI-based
                  sensing of modern WiFi features, such as 160-MHz bandwidth,
                  multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions, and
                  increased spectral resolution in IEEE 802.11ax (WiFi 6). This
                  work aims to shed light on the impact of WiFi 6 features on
                  the sensing performance and to create a benchmark for future
                  research on WiFi sensing. To this end, we perform an
                  extensive CSI data collection campaign involving 3
                  individuals, 3 environments, and 12 activities, using WiFi 6
                  signals. An anonymized ground truth obtained through video
                  recording accompanies our 80-GB dataset, which contains almost
                  two hours of CSI data from three collectors. We leverage our
                  dataset to dissect the performance of a state-of-the-art
                  sensing framework across different environments and
                  individuals. Our key findings suggest that (i) MIMO
                  transmissions and higher spectral resolution might be more
                  beneficial than larger bandwidth for sensing applications;
                  (ii) there is a pressing need to standardize research on WiFi
                  sensing because the path towards a truly
                  environment-independent framework is still uncertain. To ease
                  the experiments' replicability and address the current lack of

                  introduces two new denial of service attacks against
                  contemporary WiFi 5 and 6 networks. Differently to similar
                  works in the literature which focus on 802.11 management

  abstract =     {Video capture is the most extensively utilized human
                  perception source due to its intuitively understandable
                  nature. A desired video capture often requires multiple
                  environmental conditions such as ample ambient-light,
                  unobstructed space, and proper camera angle. In contrast,
                  wireless measurements are more ubiquitous and have fewer
                  environmental constraints. In this paper, we propose
                  CSI2Video, a novel cross-modal method that leverages only WiFi
                  signals from commercial devices and a source of human identity
                  information to recover fine-grained surveillance video in a
                  real-time manner. Specifically, two tailored deep neural
                  networks are designed to conduct cross-modal mapping and video
                  generation tasks respectively. We make use of an
                  auto-encoder-based structure to extract pose features from
                  WiFi frames. Afterward, both extracted pose features and
                  identity information are merged to generate synthetic
                  surveillance video. Our solution generates realistic
                  surveillance videos without any expensive wireless equipment
                  and has ubiquitous, cheap, and real-time characteristics.},

  abstract =     {Contact tracing requires a strong understanding of the context
                  of a user, and location with other sensory data could provide
                  a context for any infection encounter. Although Bluetooth
                  technology gives a good insight into the proximity aspect of
                  an encounter, it does not provide any location context related
                  to it which helps to make better decisions. Using the ideas
                  presented in this paper, one shall be able to obtain this
                  valuable information that could address the problem of
                  false-positive and false-negative to a certain extent. All of
                  this within the purview of Google/Apple Exposure Notification
                  (GAEN) specification, while preserving complete user privacy.
                  There are four ways of propagating context between any two
                  users. Two such methods allow private location logging,
                  without revealing the location history within an app. The
                  other two are encryption-based methods. The first encryption
                  method is a variant of Apple's FindMy protocol, that allows
                  nearby Apple devices to capture the GPS location of a lost
                  Apple device. The second encryption is a minor modification of
                  the existing GAEN protocol so that global context is available
                  to a healthy phone only when it is exposed - this is a better
                  option comparatively. It will still be the role of Public
                  Health smartphone app to decide, on how to use the
                  location-time context, to build a full-fledged contact tracing
                  and public health solution. Lastly, we highlight the benefits
                  and potential privacy issues with each of these context
                  propagation methods proposed here.},

  abstract =     {During the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic, Contact Tracing
                  emerged as an essential tool for managing the epidemic.
                  App-based solutions have emerged for Contact Tracing,
                  including a protocol designed by Apple and Google (influenced
                  by an open-source protocol known as DP3T). This protocol
                  contains two well-documented de-anonymisation attacks. Firstly
                  that when someone is marked as having tested positive and
                  their keys are made public, they can be tracked over a large
                  geographic area for 24 hours at a time. Secondly, whilst the
                  app requires a minimum exposure duration to register a
                  contact, there is no cryptographic guarantee for this
                  property. This means an adversary can scan Bluetooth networks
                  and retrospectively find who is infected. We propose a novel
                  "cross hashing" approach to cryptographically guarantee
                  minimum exposure durations. We further mitigate the 24-hour
                  data exposure of infected individuals and reduce computational
                  time for identifying if a user has been exposed using
                  $k$-Anonymous buckets of hashes and Private Set Intersection.
                  We empirically demonstrate that this modified protocol can
                  offer like-for-like efficacy to the existing protocol.},

                  used to identify both a de-tangled mesh as well as to track
                  the mesh successfully. A de-tangled mesh is a mesh with an
                  anomaly where one or more nodes are separated from the rest of
                  the mesh network. We demonstrate the performance model of a
                  hybrid BLE mesh-PLC network by considering an air cargo
                  monitoring application and validate with experimental PDR and
                  latency data. The link uncertainty in Bluetooth Low Energy
                  (BLE) mesh may be attributed to (a) RF
                  interference,(b)~Transmitter's vicinity range, and (c)
                  Receiver sensitivity. In contrast, the link uncertainty in
                  Power Line Communication (PLC) may be attributed to: (a)
                  Colored background noise, (b)~Channel frequency response, and
                  (c) Impulse noise appearing due to load state as well as
                  variations in the powerline. In our work, we construct an
                  equivalent Bayesian network for the mesh to be tracked,
                  capture the uncertainty within the mesh links using the
                  Noisy-OR and the Noisy-Integer addition model and perform
                  belief propagation to detect and localize a network anomaly.},

                  protocol, designed to support interoperability and
                  communication between iOS and macOS devices, and show that the
                  price for this seamless experience is leakage of identifying
                  information and behavioral data to passive adversaries. First,
                  we reverse engineer numerous Continuity protocol message types
                  and identify data fields that are transmitted unencrypted. We
                  show that Continuity messages are broadcast over BLE in
                  response to actions such as locking and unlocking a device's
                  screen, copying and pasting information, making and accepting
                  phone calls, and tapping the screen while it is unlocked.
                  Laboratory experiments reveal a significant flaw in the most
                  recent versions of macOS that defeats BLE Media Access Control
                  (MAC) address randomization entirely by causing the public MAC
                  address to be broadcast. We demonstrate that the format and
                  content of Continuity messages can be used to fingerprint the
                  type and Operating System (OS) version of a device, as well as
                  behaviorally profile users. Finally, we show that predictable
                  sequence numbers in these frames can allow an adversary to
                  track Apple devices across space and time, defeating existing
                  anti-tracking techniques such as MAC address randomization.},

  abstract =     {Bluetooth (BT) has revolutionized close-range communication
                  enabling smart capabilities in everyday devices through
                  wireless technology. One of the most important sub-domains of
                  Internet-of-Things (IoT) specializes in the usage of BT
                  technologies to develop smart homes and environments, which
                  include hospitals, buildings, shopping facilities, etc. to
                  offer a wide-range of features, like instantaneous and remote
                  access to ventilation, lighting, security, localization, and
                  tracking. However, the deployment of such features in smart
                  infrastructures are typically unaccompanied by appropriate
                  security measures that safeguard the data and protect its
                  users. Towards this, we propose the ATLAS framework, which is
                  composed of our novel IoT architecture and secure networking
                  stack that can be used to anonymously localize and track
                  smartphones and wearables by deploying multiple Bluetooth Low
                  Energy (BLE) beacons across the environment. The proposed
                  networking stack enables varying levels of encryption across
                  all layers of the communication stack to ensure an
                  easy-to-adopt, secure-by-design network architecture. We also
                  deploy a novel data transformation and fingerprinting-based
                  localization algorithm, which is highly effective in
                  localizing user devices within a given area. The ATLAS
                  framework is open-sourced at https://atlas-tuw.sourceforge.io
                  to enable wide-spread adoption and further research and

  abstract =     {RF fingerprinting is emerging as a physical layer security
                  scheme to identify illegitimate and/or unauthorized emitters
                  sharing the RF spectrum. However, due to the lack of publicly
                  accessible real-world datasets, most research focuses on
                  generating synthetic waveforms with software-defined radios
                  (SDRs) which are not suited for practical deployment settings.
                  On other hand, the limited datasets that are available focus
                  only on chipsets that generate only one kind of waveform.
                  Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) combo chipsets that support
                  two wireless standards (for example WiFi and Bluetooth) over a
                  shared dual-band antenna such as those found in laptops,
                  adapters, wireless chargers, Raspberry Pis, among others are
                  becoming ubiquitous in the IoT realm. Hence, to keep up with
                  the modern IoT environment, there is a pressing need for
                  real-world open datasets capturing emissions from these combo
                  chipsets transmitting heterogeneous communication protocols.
                  To this end, we capture the first known emissions from the
                  COTS IoT chipsets transmitting WiFi and Bluetooth under two
                  different time frames. The different time frames are essential
                  to rigorously evaluate the generalization capability of the
                  models. To ensure widespread use, each capture within the
                  comprehensive 72 GB dataset is long enough (40 MSamples) to
                  support diverse input tensor lengths and formats. Finally, the
                  dataset also comprises emissions at varying signal powers to
                  account for the feeble to high signal strength emissions as
                  encountered in a real-world setting.},

  abstract =     {Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become an intrinsic wireless
                  technology for the Internet of Things (IoT). With the
                  proliferation of BLE-embedded IoT devices, it is important to
                  study the security and privacy implications of BLE. The
                  forefront attack to BLE devices is the wireless sniffing
                  attack, which would lead to more detrimental threats like
                  jamming, encryption cracking or system penetration. Existing
                  sniffing attacks are based on the correct detection of BLE
                  connection initiation state, but they become ineffective for
                  BLE long-lived connections. In this paper, we focus on the
                  adversary setting with a low-cost single radio and develop a
                  suite of real-time algorithms to determine the key parameters
                  necessary to follow and sniff a BLE connection in the
                  connected state. We implement our algorithms in the open
                  source platform -Ubertooth One and evaluate its performance in
                  terms of sniffing overhead and accuracy. By comparing with
                  state-of-the-art schemes, experimental results show that our
                  sniffer achieves much higher sniffing accuracy (over 80\%) and
                  better stability to BLE operational dynamics.},

  abstract =     {Bluetooth technology has enabled short-range wireless
                  communication for billions of devices. Bluetooth Low-Energy
                  (BLE) variant aims at improving power consumption on
                  battery-constrained devices. BLE-enabled devices broadcast
                  information (e.g., as beacons) to nearby devices via
                  advertisements. Unfortunately, such functionality can become a
                  double-edged sword at the hands of attackers. In this paper,
                  we primarily show how an attacker can exploit BLE
                  advertisements to exfiltrate information from BLE-enable
                  devices. In particular, our attack establishes a communication
                  medium between two devices without requiring any prior
                  authentication or pairing. We develop a proof-of-concept
                  attack framework on the Android ecosystem and assess its
                  performance via a thorough set of experiments. Our results
                  indicate that such an exfiltration attack is indeed possible
                  though with a limited data rate. Nevertheless, we also
                  demonstrate potential use cases and enhancements to our attack
                  that can further its severeness. Finally, we discuss possible
                  countermeasures to prevent such an attack.},

  abstract =     {Optimal Transport (OT) has recently emerged as a central tool
                  in data sciences to compare in a geometrically faithful way
                  point clouds and more generally probability distributions. The
                  wide adoption of OT into existing data analysis and machine
                  learning pipelines is however plagued by several shortcomings.
                  This includes its lack of robustness to outliers, its high
                  computational costs, the need for a large number of samples in
                  high dimension and the difficulty to handle data in distinct
                  spaces. In this review, we detail several recently proposed
                  approaches to mitigate these issues. We insist in particular
                  on unbalanced OT, which compares arbitrary positive measures,
                  not restricted to probability distributions (i.e. their total
                  mass can vary). This generalization of OT makes it robust to
                  outliers and missing data. The second workhorse of modern
                  computational OT is entropic regularization, which leads to
                  scalable algorithms while lowering the sample complexity in
                  high dimension. The last point presented in this review is the
                  Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, which extends OT to cope
                  with distributions belonging to different metric spaces. The
                  main motivation for this review is to explain how unbalanced
                  OT, entropic regularization and GW can work hand-in-hand to
                  turn OT into efficient geometric loss functions for data
                  sciences.},

                  similarity measure, which aims to evaluate the distance

                  provide an overview of spatio-temporal trajectory measures in

                  Learning, Free Space vs. Road Network, and Standalone vs.
                  Distributed. Next, we present an evaluation benchmark by
                  designing five real-world transformation scenarios. Based on

  abstract =     {With recent advancements, the wireless local area network
                  (WLAN) or wireless fidelity (WiFi) technology has been
                  successfully utilized to realize sensing functionalities such
                  as detection, localization, and recognition. However, the
                  WLANs standards are developed mainly for the purpose of
                  communication, and thus may not be able to meet the stringent
                  sensing requirements in emerging applications. To resolve this
                  issue, a new Task Group (TG), namely IEEE 802.11bf, has been
                  established by the IEEE 802.11 working group, with the
                  objective of creating a new amendment to the WLAN standard to
                  provide advanced sensing requirements while minimizing the
                  effect on communications. This paper provides a comprehensive
                  overview on the up-to-date efforts in the IEEE 802.11bf TG.
                  First, we introduce the definition of the 802.11bf amendment
                  and its standardization timeline. Then, we discuss the WLAN
                  sensing procedure and framework used for measurement
                  acquisition, by considering both conventional sensing at sub-7
                  GHz and directional multi-gigabit (DMG) sensing at 60 GHz,
                  respectively. Next, we present various candidate technical
                  features for IEEE 802.11bf, including waveform/sequence
                  design, feedback types, quantization, as well as security and
                  privacy. Finally, we describe the methodologies used by the
                  IEEE 802.11bf TG to evaluate the alternative performance. It
                  is desired that this overview paper provide useful insights on
                  IEEE 802.11 WLAN sensing to people with great interests and
                  promote the IEEE 802.11bf standard to be widely deployed.},

                  inconvenient to use. To address these issues, wireless sensing
                  has emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging LiDAR,
                  mmWave radar, and WiFi signals for device-free human sensing.
                  In this paper, we propose MM-Fi, the first multi-modal
                  non-intrusive 4D human dataset with 27 daily or rehabilitation
                  action categories, to bridge the gap between wireless sensing
                  and high-level human perception tasks. MM-Fi consists of over
                  320k synchronized frames of five modalities from 40 human
                  subjects. Various annotations are provided to support
                  potential sensing tasks, e.g., human pose estimation and
                  action recognition. Extensive experiments have been conducted
                  to compare the sensing capacity of each or several modalities
                  in terms of multiple tasks. We envision that MM-Fi can
                  contribute to wireless sensing research with respect to action
                  recognition, human pose estimation, multi-modal learning,
                  cross-modal supervision, and interdisciplinary healthcare
                  research.},

                  the precise determination of the presence and the number of

                  does not require active cooperation of persons present in the

                  show that the standard deviation of the measured RSSI data can
                  be used as a practical tool to establish the presence of a
                  person (or more persons) with high precision, in particular
                  when the signal source is inside the measurement room. For the

                  technologies in smart cities. Currently, there are two major
                  pain points that plague related research and practitioners.
                  Firstly, crowd flow is related to multiple domain knowledge
                  factors; however, due to the diversity of application
                  scenarios, it is difficult for subsequent work to make
                  reasonable and comprehensive use of domain knowledge.
                  Secondly, with the development of deep learning technology,
                  the implementation of relevant techniques has become
                  increasingly complex; reproducing advanced models has become a
                  time-consuming and increasingly cumbersome task. To address
                  these issues, we design and implement a spatiotemporal crowd
                  flow prediction toolbox called UCTB (Urban Computing Tool
                  Box), which integrates multiple spatiotemporal domain
                  knowledge and state-of-the-art models simultaneously. The
                  relevant code and supporting documents have been open-sourced

  abstract =     {Contextual features are important data sources for building
                  citywide crowd mobility prediction models. However, the
                  difficulty of applying context lies in the unknown
                  generalizability of contextual features (e.g., weather,
                  holiday, and points of interests) and context modeling
                  techniques across different scenarios. In this paper, we
                  present a unified analytic framework and a large-scale
                  benchmark for evaluating context generalizability. The
                  benchmark includes crowd mobility data, contextual data, and
                  advanced prediction models. We conduct comprehensive
                  experiments in several crowd mobility prediction tasks such as
                  bike flow, metro passenger flow, and electric vehicle charging
                  demand. Our results reveal several important observations: (1)
                  Using more contextual features may not always result in better
                  prediction with existing context modeling techniques; in
                  particular, the combination of holiday and temporal position
                  can provide more generalizable beneficial information than
                  other contextual feature combinations. (2) In context modeling
                  techniques, using a gated unit to incorporate raw contextual
                  features into the deep prediction model has good
                  generalizability. Besides, we offer several suggestions about
                  incorporating contextual factors for building crowd mobility
                  prediction applications. From our findings, we call for future
                  research efforts devoted to developing new context modeling
                  solutions.},

                  consistency in video sequences, and those that do only impose

                  locations between consecutive images and inferring the people
                  densities from these flows instead of directly regressing.
                  This enables us to impose much stronger constraints encoding
                  the conservation of the number of people. As a result, it

  abstract =     {We present RoboGen, a generative robotic agent that
                  automatically learns diverse robotic skills at scale via
                  generative simulation. RoboGen leverages the latest
                  advancements in foundation and generative models. Instead of
                  directly using or adapting these models to produce policies or
                  low-level actions, we advocate for a generative scheme, which
                  uses these models to automatically generate diversified tasks,
                  scenes, and training supervisions, thereby scaling up robotic
                  skill learning with minimal human supervision. Our approach
                  equips a robotic agent with a self-guided
                  propose-generate-learn cycle: the agent first proposes
                  interesting tasks and skills to develop, and then generates
                  corresponding simulation environments by populating pertinent
                  objects and assets with proper spatial configurations.
                  Afterwards, the agent decomposes the proposed high-level task
                  into sub-tasks, selects the optimal learning approach
                  (reinforcement learning, motion planning, or trajectory
                  optimization), generates required training supervision, and
                  then learns policies to acquire the proposed skill. Our work
                  attempts to extract the extensive and versatile knowledge
                  embedded in large-scale models and transfer them to the field
                  of robotics. Our fully generative pipeline can be queried
                  repeatedly, producing an endless stream of skill
                  demonstrations associated with diverse tasks and
                  environments.},

                  framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) as a

                  domain-specific AI modules, enabling IoT devices to
                  collaborate effectively in executing complex tasks. The LLM
                  performs planning and generates control scripts using a
                  reliable and precise language-code transformation approach
                  based on finite state machines (FSMs). The LLM engages in
                  natural conversations with users, employing role-playing
                  techniques to generate contextually appropriate responses.
                  Additionally, users can interact easily with the AI agent via
                  a user-friendly social media platform. The framework also
                  incorporates semantic analysis and response optimization

                  this framework is designed not only to innovate IoT device
                  control and enrich user experiences but also to foster an

                  combat greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. The
                  efficient management of room occupancy, involving actions like
                  lighting control and climate adjustment, is a pivotal strategy
                  to curtail energy consumption. In contexts where surveillance
                  technology isn't viable, non-intrusive sensors are employed to
                  estimate room occupancy. In this study, we present a
                  predictive framework for room occupancy that leverages a
                  diverse set of machine learning models, with Random Forest
                  consistently achieving the highest predictive accuracy.
                  Notably, this dataset encompasses both temporal and spatial
                  dimensions, revealing a wealth of information. Intriguingly,
                  our framework demonstrates robust performance even in the
                  absence of explicit temporal modeling. These findings
                  underscore the remarkable predictive power of traditional
                  machine learning models. The success can be attributed to the
                  presence of feature redundancy, the simplicity of linear
                  spatial and temporal patterns, and the advantages of
                  high-frequency data sampling. While these results are
                  compelling, it's essential to remain open to the possibility
                  that explicitly modeling the temporal dimension could unlock
                  deeper insights or further enhance predictive capabilities in
                  specific scenarios. In summary, our research not only
                  validates the effectiveness of our prediction framework for
                  continuous and classification tasks but also underscores the
                  potential for improvements through the inclusion of temporal
                  aspects. The study highlights the promise of machine learning
                  in shaping energy-efficient practices and room occupancy

  abstract =     {Embedded camera systems are ubiquitous, representing the most
                  widely deployed example of a wireless embedded system. They
                  capture a representation of the world - the surroundings
                  illuminated by visible or infrared light. Despite their
                  widespread usage, the architecture of embedded camera systems
                  has remained unchanged, which leads to limitations. They
                  visualize only a tiny portion of the world. Additionally, they
                  are energy-intensive, leading to limited battery lifespan. We
                  present PixelGen, which re-imagines embedded camera systems.
                  Specifically, PixelGen combines sensors, transceivers, and
                  low-resolution image and infrared vision sensors to capture a
                  broader world representation. They are deliberately chosen for
                  their simplicity, low bitrate, and power consumption,
                  culminating in an energy-efficient platform. We show that
                  despite the simplicity, the captured data can be processed
                  using transformer-based image and language models to generate
                  novel representations of the environment. For example, we
                  demonstrate that it can allow the generation of
                  high-definition images, while the camera utilises low-power,
                  low-resolution monochrome cameras. Furthermore, the
                  capabilities of PixelGen extend beyond traditional
                  photography, enabling visualization of phenomena invisible to
                  conventional cameras, such as sound waves. PixelGen can enable
                  numerous novel applications, and we demonstrate that it
                  enables unique visualization of the surroundings that are then
                  projected on extended reality headsets. We believe, PixelGen
                  goes beyond conventional cameras and opens new avenues for
                  research and photography.},

  abstract =     {With recent advances in sensing technologies, a myriad of
                  spatio-temporal data has been generated and recorded in smart
                  cities. Forecasting the evolution patterns of spatio-temporal
                  data is an important yet demanding aspect of urban computing,
                  which can enhance intelligent management decisions in various
                  fields, including transportation, environment, climate, public
                  safety, healthcare, and others. Traditional statistical and
                  deep learning methods struggle to capture complex correlations
                  in urban spatio-temporal data. To this end, Spatio-Temporal
                  Graph Neural Networks (STGNN) have been proposed, achieving
                  great promise in recent years. STGNNs enable the extraction of
                  complex spatio-temporal dependencies by integrating graph
                  neural networks (GNNs) and various temporal learning methods.
                  In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive survey on
                  recent progress on STGNN technologies for predictive learning
                  in urban computing. Firstly, we provide a brief introduction
                  to the construction methods of spatio-temporal graph data and
                  the prevalent deep-learning architectures used in STGNNs. We
                  then sort out the primary application domains and specific
                  predictive learning tasks based on existing literature.
                  Afterward, we scrutinize the design of STGNNs and their
                  combination with some advanced technologies in recent years.
                  Finally, we conclude the limitations of existing research and
                  suggest potential directions for future work.},

                  few years. These powerful algorithms expanded deep learning

                  of art performance in various applications including
                  recommender systems and social networks. However, this

                  availability of data containing rich spatial and temporal
                  information, offering valuable insights into dynamic systems
                  and processes for applications such as weather forecasting,
                  natural disaster management, intelligent transport systems,
                  and precision agriculture. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have
                  emerged as a powerful tool for modeling and understanding data
                  with dependencies to each other such as spatial and temporal
                  dependencies. There is a large amount of existing work that
                  focuses on addressing the complex spatial and temporal
                  dependencies in spatiotemporal data using GNNs. However, the
                  strong interdisciplinary nature of spatiotemporal data has
                  created numerous GNNs variants specifically designed for
                  distinct application domains. Although the techniques are
                  generally applicable across various domains, cross-referencing
                  these methods remains essential yet challenging due to the
                  absence of a comprehensive literature review on GNNs for
                  spatiotemporal data. This article aims to provide a systematic
                  and comprehensive overview of the technologies and
                  applications of GNNs in the spatiotemporal domain. First, the
                  ways of constructing graphs from spatiotemporal data are
                  summarized to help domain experts understand how to generate
                  graphs from various types of spatiotemporal data. Then, a
                  systematic categorization and summary of existing
                  spatiotemporal GNNs are presented to enable domain experts to
                  identify suitable techniques and to support model developers
                  in advancing their research. Moreover, a comprehensive
                  overview of significant applications in the spatiotemporal
                  domain is offered to introduce a broader range of applications
                  to model developers and domain experts, assisting them in
                  exploring potential research topics and enhancing the impact

                  popularity as a powerful tool for effectively modeling
                  spatio-temporal dependencies in diverse real-world urban
                  applications, including intelligent transportation and public
                  safety. However, the black-box nature of STGNNs limits their
                  interpretability, hindering their application in scenarios
                  related to urban resource allocation and policy formulation.
                  To bridge this gap, we propose an Explainable Spatio-Temporal
                  Graph Neural Networks (STExplainer) framework that enhances
                  STGNNs with inherent explainability, enabling them to provide
                  accurate predictions and faithful explanations simultaneously.
                  Our framework integrates a unified spatio-temporal graph
                  attention network with a positional information fusion layer
                  as the STG encoder and decoder, respectively. Furthermore, we
                  propose a structure distillation approach based on the Graph
                  Information Bottleneck (GIB) principle with an explainable
                  objective, which is instantiated by the STG encoder and
                  decoder. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
                  our STExplainer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
                  terms of predictive accuracy and explainability metrics (i.e.,
                  sparsity and fidelity) on traffic and crime prediction tasks.
                  Furthermore, our model exhibits superior representation
                  ability in alleviating data missing and sparsity issues. The

                  These capabilities hold significant promise for their
                  application in urban traffic management and control. However,
                  LLMs struggle with addressing traffic issues, especially
                  processing numerical data and interacting with simulations,
                  limiting their potential in solving traffic-related
                  challenges. In parallel, specialized traffic foundation models
                  exist but are typically designed for specific tasks with
                  limited input-output interactions. Combining these models with
                  LLMs presents an opportunity to enhance their capacity for

                  insightful suggestions. To bridge this gap, we present
                  TrafficGPT, a fusion of ChatGPT and traffic foundation models.
                  This integration yields the following key enhancements: 1)
                  empowering ChatGPT with the capacity to view, analyze, process
                  traffic data, and provide insightful decision support for
                  urban transportation system management; 2) facilitating the
                  intelligent deconstruction of broad and complex tasks and
                  sequential utilization of traffic foundation models for their
                  gradual completion; 3) aiding human decision-making in traffic
                  control through natural language dialogues; and 4) enabling

                  seamlessly intertwining large language model and traffic
                  expertise, TrafficGPT not only advances traffic management but
                  also offers a novel approach to leveraging AI capabilities in

                  foundation models such as ChatGPT marks a revolutionary shift
                  in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
                  Their unparalleled capabilities in contextual understanding,

                  suggest that integrating these models into urban domains could
                  have a transformative impact on the development of smart

                  as well as multiple information modalities, such as a spatial

                  and semantics among various spatiotemporal modal data, the
                  joint interpretation of multimodal spatiotemporal data has
                  been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge
                  resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and
                  autonomy of diverse modalities, and this trade-off exhibits a
                  progressively nonlinear nature as the number of modalities
                  expands. We introduce the Language as Reference Framework
                  (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal
                  unified model, aiming to strike a trade-off between the
                  cohesion and autonomy among different modalities. We propose a
                  multimodal spatiotemporal general artificial intelligence
                  model, called AllSpark. Our model integrates thirteen
                  different modalities into a unified framework, including 1D
                  (text, code), 2D (RGB, infrared, SAR, multispectral,
                  hyperspectral, tables, graphs, trajectory, oblique
                  photography), and 3D (point clouds, videos) modalities. To
                  achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark uniformly maps diverse modal
                  features to the language modality. In addition, we design
                  modality-specific prompts to guide multi-modal large language
                  models in accurately perceiving multimodal data. To maintain
                  modality autonomy, AllSpark introduces modality-specific
                  encoders to extract the tokens of various spatiotemporal
                  modalities. And modal bridge is employed to achieve
                  dimensional projection from each modality to the language
                  modality. Finally, observing a gap between the model's
                  interpretation and downstream tasks, we designed task heads to
                  enhance the model's generalization capability on specific
                  downstream tasks. Experiments indicate that AllSpark achieves
                  competitive accuracy in modalities such as RGB and trajectory
                  compared to state-of-the-art models.},

                  intelligent transportation systems (ITS), but it faces many
                  challenges in the transportation domain, such as
                  domain-specific knowledge and data, and multi-modal inputs and
                  outputs. This paper presents TransGPT, a novel (multi-modal)
                  large language model for the transportation domain, which
                  consists of two independent variants: TransGPT-SM for
                  single-modal data and TransGPT-MM for multi-modal data.
                  TransGPT-SM is finetuned on a single-modal Transportation
                  dataset (STD) that contains textual data from various sources
                  in the transportation domain. TransGPT-MM is finetuned on a
                  multi-modal Transportation dataset (MTD) that we manually
                  collected from three areas of the transportation domain:
                  driving tests, traffic signs, and landmarks. We evaluate
                  TransGPT on several benchmark datasets for different tasks in
                  the transportation domain, and show that it outperforms
                  baseline models on most tasks. We also showcase the potential
                  applications of TransGPT for traffic analysis and modeling,
                  such as generating synthetic traffic scenarios, explaining
                  traffic phenomena, answering traffic-related questions,
                  providing traffic recommendations, and generating traffic
                  reports. This work advances the state-of-the-art of NLP in the

  abstract =     {Urban knowledge graph has recently worked as an emerging
                  building block to distill critical knowledge from
                  multi-sourced urban data for diverse urban application
                  scenarios. Despite its promising benefits, urban knowledge
                  graph construction (UrbanKGC) still heavily relies on manual
                  effort, hindering its potential advancement. This paper
                  presents UrbanKGent, a unified large language model agent
                  framework, for urban knowledge graph construction.
                  Specifically, we first construct the knowledgeable instruction
                  set for UrbanKGC tasks (such as relational triplet extraction
                  and knowledge graph completion) via heterogeneity-aware and
                  geospatial-infused instruction generation. Moreover, we
                  propose a tool-augmented iterative trajectory refinement
                  module to enhance and refine the trajectories distilled from
                  GPT-4. Through hybrid instruction fine-tuning with augmented
                  trajectories on Llama-2-13B, we obtain the UrbanKGC agent,
                  UrbanKGent-13B. We perform a comprehensive evaluation on two
                  real-world datasets using both human and GPT-4
                  self-evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that
                  UrbanKGent-13B not only can significantly outperform 21
                  baselines in UrbanKGC tasks, but also surpass the
                  state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4, by more than 10\% with
                  approximately 20 times lower cost. We deploy UrbanKGent-13B to
                  provide online services, which can construct an UrbanKG with
                  thousands of times richer relationships using only one-fifth
                  of the data compared with the existing benchmark. Our data,
                  code, and opensource UrbanKGC agent are available at

  abstract =     {Causality has the potential to truly transform the way we
                  solve a large number of real-world problems. Yet, so far, its
                  potential largely remains to be unlocked as causality often
                  requires crucial assumptions which cannot be tested in
                  practice. To address this challenge, we propose a new way of
                  thinking about causality -- we call this causal deep learning.
                  Our causal deep learning framework spans three dimensions: (1)
                  a structural dimension, which incorporates partial yet
                  testable causal knowledge rather than assuming either complete
                  or no causal knowledge among the variables of interest; (2) a
                  parametric dimension, which encompasses parametric forms that
                  capture the type of relationships among the variables of
                  interest; and (3) a temporal dimension, which captures
                  exposure times or how the variables of interest interact
                  (possibly causally) over time. Causal deep learning enables us
                  to make progress on a variety of real-world problems by
                  leveraging partial causal knowledge (including independencies
                  among variables) and quantitatively characterising causal
                  relationships among variables of interest (possibly over
                  time). Our framework clearly identifies which assumptions are
                  testable and which ones are not, such that the resulting
                  solutions can be judiciously adopted in practice. Using our
                  formulation we can combine or chain together causal
                  representations to solve specific problems without losing
                  track of which assumptions are required to build these
                  solutions, pushing real-world impact in healthcare, economics
                  and business, environmental sciences and education, through
                  causal deep learning.},

                  link prediction and recommendation using real-world datasets.
                  However, the majority of current methods rely on static data,
                  neglecting the dynamic nature and the hidden spatio-temporal
                  attributes of real-world scenarios. This often results in
                  suboptimal predictions and recommendations. Although there are

  abstract =     {It has long been hypothesised that causal reasoning plays a
                  fundamental role in robust and general intelligence. However,
                  it is not known if agents must learn causal models in order to
                  generalise to new domains, or if other inductive biases are
                  sufficient. We answer this question, showing that any agent
                  capable of satisfying a regret bound under a large set of
                  distributional shifts must have learned an approximate causal
                  model of the data generating process, which converges to the
                  true causal model for optimal agents. We discuss the
                  implications of this result for several research areas
                  including transfer learning and causal inference.},

                  Framework for Personal Mobility Generation},

  abstract =     {This paper introduces a novel approach using Large Language
                  Models (LLMs) integrated into an agent framework for flexible
                  and efficient personal mobility generation. LLMs overcome the
                  limitations of previous models by efficiently processing
                  semantic data and offering versatility in modeling various
                  tasks. Our approach addresses the critical need to align LLMs
                  with real-world urban mobility data, focusing on three
                  research questions: aligning LLMs with rich activity data,
                  developing reliable activity generation strategies, and
                  exploring LLM applications in urban mobility. The key
                  technical contribution is a novel LLM agent framework that
                  accounts for individual activity patterns and motivations,
                  including a self-consistency approach to align LLMs with
                  real-world activity data and a retrieval-augmented strategy
                  for interpretable activity generation. In experimental
                  studies, comprehensive validation is performed using
                  real-world data. This research marks the pioneering work of
                  designing an LLM agent framework for activity generation based
                  on real-world human activity data, offering a promising tool
                  for urban mobility analysis.},
